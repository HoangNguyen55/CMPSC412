20
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Hello, I

21
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,080
Need to push my PC back under my desk. It's too loud. I could hear it. Oh my god. Shut up

22
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,480
It's because I was exporting something in from here anyways, sorry. Thank you for waiting everybody. Hello. Welcome to

23
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,840
Super Sunday. Hold on. Let me fix one thing

24
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,620
Baba bot should be live, right? I hope

25
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Baba bot is live, right?

26
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,840
Super Sunday. Hello everybody. Thank you guys so much for the super chat. So yeah, this uh

27
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,960
This stream is a Sunday. You guys know

28
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
dedicated to rating super chats

29
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,840
Yeah, good to see you guys again. Am I I feel like uh, hold on one second

30
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,360
Hi, my head's small, okay, this is better wait, not really

31
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,840
That looks normal sort of maybe a little bit bigger

32
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
It looks

33
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
somewhat normal, okay

34
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
My immersion, oh no, oh you'll live you'll live

35
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Oh

36
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Man I was gonna bring berries

37
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,200
I was gonna bring berries to the stream. I had blackberries and I left them in the kitchen

38
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Well, I get them later. Yes, uh, Baba is already on although there's no song requests open

39
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm gonna open up the song cue now

40
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Give me one a moment

41
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,280
How can you add songs great question

42
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,560
well

43
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,200
you would do exclamation point SR which stands for song request and then put the link of the song you would like to request in

44
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
in the chat of Bubba, but

45
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Which I don't remember the

46
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Command is it working? Oh

47
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Hold on, let me check something really quick one sec

48
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
You

49
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,560
Okay, now Bubba about his playing can you guys hear it sorry I had to hold on

50
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Okay

51
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,240
Okay, yeah, it's loud okay, I'll turn down a little bit

52
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Okay, turn it down is that better

53
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:39,120
You can hear now, okay cool. So yeah, the key is already open and it fills up really fast because you guys are like

54
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
robots

55
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,120
Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm

56
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,480
Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know

57
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,680
I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm

58
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream

59
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,160
But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed

60
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,080
And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out

61
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:25,520
So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub

62
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,400
It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower

63
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
Mm-hmm

64
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,360
Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle

65
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,960
So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably

66
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,920
I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover

67
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins

68
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
They're pretty good. I think I

69
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,440
Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I

70
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,440
Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead

71
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,000
Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a

72
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,040
It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you

73
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Where is it, um

74
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Let's see

75
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Okay

76
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Weird hold on let me cut there for a second

77
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Oh

78
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,800
Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?

79
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Disappeared

80
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
The office is gone

81
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Doesn't make any sense

82
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't make no sense. Wait

83
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
There's that

84
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,560
It's probably just like an OBS problem

85
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Oh

86
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,920
What if I duplicate

87
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,960
All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh

88
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here

89
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,680
Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office

90
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,160
I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect

91
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,640
We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh

92
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
And it's like it looks 3d

93
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,520
Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else

94
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,040
Are you guys doing today on this Sunday? Oh

95
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,520
That's better now it doesn't look like I'm reading although my arms look so big

96
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Good

97
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Does that work

98
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,080
Is it I think it's just too big in general

99
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,520
Immersion chillin at bed nice hungry get a snack

100
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:22,560
That's a little bit better maybe just a tiny bit

101
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:35,520
Wait, is this is this lined up this where is this supposed to be? Oh here looks so high

102
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:45,240
Okay, well what it looks scuff to me wait, okay, I just don't look don't look don't look don't look

103
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,000
What happened to Papa but is it playing cuz I don't hear anything

104
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,920
Is it just a really quiet song is there just like a minute of silence at the end of a song or something

105
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,920
It stopped it broke

106
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:21,800
But it only lets me play this one song. Well, then let me reload it really quick

107
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:38,720
Okay, hopefully that fixed it. Yeah, I guess it has to be this way. Very funny. Very funny. Yeah

108
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Shoot

109
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,800
I'm trying to hide this misaligned pillow. Oh, what is this? Maybe if I

110
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,760
Look the pillow has like a little bite taken out of it. I think it's supposed to go by this armrest, but it don't fit

111
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,960
So I'm a lid I won't fit

112
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:16,920
Okay, we'll say that that's don't look oh my god don't look what this is confusing

Wait, does anybody know where from where I'm reading from super chat's from my head is too big

119
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Oh

120
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,420
Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you

121
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,260
Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank

122
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:36,500
Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about

123
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,340
Oh

124
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,340
You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs

125
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,900
I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to

126
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
Just to like go outside and talk

127
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
with person at the store

128
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,860
But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream

129
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,580
I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I

130
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:16,020
Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just

131
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Not healthy for my tummy. Oh

132
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,740
What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule

133
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Oh

134
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,940
Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up

135
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,980
For the next

136
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,500
The next coming this coming week, let's see

137
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,420
I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was

138
00:20:51,420 --> 00:21:01,020
Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday

139
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,620
Wait, yes, it was a Monday

140
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,020
No

141
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
It was on Tuesday

142
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,380
Okay, okay

143
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,820
Sorry, sorry

144
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule

145
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
sort of

146
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,940
Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring

147
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
starting at AMT time and

148
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:33,380
Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think

149
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,500
So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier

150
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,820
So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week

151
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,420
Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet

152
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,940
If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream

153
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,600
I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream

154
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,340
So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know

155
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,660
I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and

156
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,540
Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring

157
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:17,500
I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark

158
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,340
So I'm not sure

159
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,340
If it's gonna be on that day

160
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,540
But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh

161
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Then on Friday

162
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:43,860
What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one

163
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,380
Keep having to refresh it every time

164
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:58,620
Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now

165
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,380
I

166
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:52,380
I

167
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
I

168
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,900
Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something

169
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,620
That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing

170
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:25,860
All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday

171
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:32,100
We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again

172
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,260
Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some

173
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,260
Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it

174
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:50,140
Is that like a bird an alarm

175
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,540

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,420
Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today

185
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
Look at the starfish

186
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,780
Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank

187
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:00,940
But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it

188
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,060
Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose

189
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:13,060
to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so

190
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,740
Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass

191
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
It's cute, right?

192
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,580
You can see the mouth in the center there

193
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,220
Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy

194
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,420
Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the

195
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,580
You know the land

196
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,780
The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to

197
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,020
Yeah, both it's both weird

198
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,060
Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small

199
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,620
so small and then also

200
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,260
Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small

201
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,460
This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought

202
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
It's um

203
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
Can I use the point?

204
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,700
It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer

205
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,260
like a little cursor to drag around the screen

206
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
Alright, I'll point with

207
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:30,700
This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone

208
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,740
I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and

209
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,140
the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and

210
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,220
Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?

211
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,220
it's

212
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,140
Okay, the video was unavailable

213
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,780
Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned

214
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,620
I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh

215
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:12,700
Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is

216
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:19,380
It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning

217
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,380
They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab

218
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,820
Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting

219
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,740
things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and

220
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:42,420
In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone

221
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
So they have like a really cute relationship

222
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:50,220
Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them

223
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,220
Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm

224
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Now you could see it

225
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,540
It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything

226
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,500
This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too

227
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,660
Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it

228
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,420
Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color

229
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,660
Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it

230
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,980
But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm

231
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,860
So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know

232
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:45,060
I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing

233
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,420
So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and

234
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,540
Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm

235
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,020
But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it

236
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
I want to protect it

237
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Yeah, this a anemone

238
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:10,660
It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute

239
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
They're so cute. And then

240
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,860
And then let me see, hold on

241
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:23,860
Hold on

242
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in

243
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,420
Okay, now I will show you guys

244
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,340
The frog

245
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,020
After I change something really quick

246
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Um

247
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
This one

248
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,620
Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm

249
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
You frog

250
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,180
Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up

251
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:17,420
All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels

252
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
There's one of the frogs

253
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,340
Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um

254
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:39,260
He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water

255
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,380
They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air

256
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,460
And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air

257
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:54,140
Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together

258
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,380
But let me see

259
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
No, this is the only picture I have actually

260
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again

261
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,620
Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them

262
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,860
Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny

263
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,420
Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out

264
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:22,020
Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space

265
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,500
Yeah, we'll see

266
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Look at them. I need to zoom in

267
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,220
Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them

268
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,420
But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams

269
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,300
Seems cute

270
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,020
What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets

271
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,580
They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face

272
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,100
They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning

273
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,980
And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing

274
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
So it was getting a mouthful of sand

275
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,100
Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it

276
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,740
No, they don't usually bother shrimp

277
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,980
Not that I've seen anyway

278
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,300
I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth

279
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,780
But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything

280
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,780
I

281
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,900
Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys

282
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,060
Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted

283
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,780
But it doesn't look like we have too much to go

284
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:51,640
I didn't have to scroll too much to get down to these super chats now reading from the apex collab with a mume

285
00:33:51,640 --> 00:34:00,240
I am ego. Thank you. We're gonna come times to thank you discuss the Batman. Thank you

286
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Maffy, thank you. Oh

287
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Right here. Thank you

288
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,400
Well, check is going in the care package. Why people don't even use it, right? What the heck?

289
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,880
I can of course die. Thank you a quick. Thank you

290
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:29,600
Rip boats in not the boats in not the boats in just a boat. Check a slow champ. Thank you. I skip it. Thank you

291
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,040
Of course that day. Thank you. I'm a cemented

292
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,400
Thank you. I'm smart boy. Thank you

293
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
worthless old crinkle

294
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Thank you

295
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,840
but

296
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,680
Thank you. Yeah, I don't think we got one win that whole time we played, huh?

297
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Fine I get wins off off

298
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,360
stream

299
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Like the one time I played apex off

300
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,520
Me for me to say thank you. Can we get 99? Thank you a new tube crashed. Thank you. Oh

301
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Kitty stamps. Thank you

302
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm right. Thank you. Number one victory for you. Well, then I got a reopen chat

303
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,600
Red Juliet, thank you pick a break. Oh

304
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Thank you. Yeah, I'm not that great at apex. I think I think I might be better at fortnight. Actually, I don't know. Yeah

305
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I'm not that good at FPS games. I think I have my moments in like FPS games

306
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,520
But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good

307
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,560
I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well

308
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,160
Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates

309
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
They start messing around in the game

310
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,120
Yeah, it's it's well

311
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,200
It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to

312
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
Mm-hmm

313
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Joshua Bernardo, thank you

314
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,160
Well, thank you, thank you a finger I think yep

315
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,560
Tk. Thank you. Wait Jesse ready? Thank you. Oh

316
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:31,560
George dedicated accounts. Thank you. Yeah, we're probably play more apex this week because I'm gonna do a wheel stream

317
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:38,240
So I think apex. Oh, yeah, do I have I should pin that wheel? Hold on do I saw if I go to the wheel?

318
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
wheel website

319
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,560
Let me see if everything's still there it is it is oh my god if I were playing it now I would get

320
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
hold on it's spinning if

321
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,320
I if I were playing the wheel now, we'd be playing heroes of the storm

322
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,680
Now members camp over wheel games I put stuff on the wheel that I feel like I wouldn't mind playing

323
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Thank you

324
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,280
Yeah, here's the soul well, we'll have to see on the day the day of wheel

325
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,200
They have wheel ah speaking of which yeah, I'll do it after the stream for sure wait

326
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,540
No, I was gonna say it. Let me set this twitch vod to download. Hold on. Let me put this on my

327
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
bookmarks bookmarked

328
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,240
Why are so many things open I'll close that at that

329
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Close it at that. Okay

330
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:47,680
I pick a wreck. Thank you Aaron Pompo. Thank you. I don't know anything. Yep. Oh Lord turn up. Thank you

331
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
95% of gamblers quit right before they hit it big

332
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Yeah, yeah. Yeah

333
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,640
That's a that's a cop if I've ever heard one

334
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,960
I'm Fred. Thanks so much for the 100 big

335
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
super chat

336
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Not a name. I've heard before

337
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,320
I'm reading super chat. So thank you so much for support

338
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Bonsie, thank you

339
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,280
Well, the thing is yes as you should turn you should turn back on the screen when playing apex as you're about to land

340
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,160
So then nobody can follow you but it's difficult because if I'm the jump master

341
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,240
I have to be tapped into the game to

342
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Well, I could put it on a hotkey

343
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
Yeah, I could put it on a hockey like uh, I

344
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,600
Guess it would be like this. Hold on. Let me see I can show you guys a demonstration if you will

350
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,440
Yeah, the readers are good. Well, I don't know it depends

351
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,160
I only want to eat like a Dorito maybe like once every six months or something. I don't know

352
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
I don't really have cravings for chips

353
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Yeah

354
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560

357
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,120
Thank you. Oh, yeah, I learned something today

358
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Well, it was like while I was reading

359
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
researching some stuff

360
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,880
Apparently if you guys look at your nails right now

361
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,960
Do you guys have like a little white half moon at the bottom part of your nail where it like connects to your finger?

362
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,360
Do you guys have that check check?

363
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
everybody check

364
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,960
Yes, yes, yep, nope. No. Yes. Yes

365
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,680
Yeah, it's called the wait. I forget what it's called Luna lei. I think Luna lei

366
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,400
Uh-huh. Yeah, it means yet. It means if you're missing it, it might mean that you have

367
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,400
issues with like nutrition or vitamins

368
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name

369
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Yeah, it's called a Luna lei

370
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,560
Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and

371
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,400
And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions

372
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,240
It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways

373
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,640
But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something

374
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,760
That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I

375
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:05,360
Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe

376
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Oh

377
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,240
That's good, maybe my I guess my feet are healthier

378
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,740
Yeah, yeah looking at look up it's like when you can tell what color it's like the color of stuff that comes out of your

379
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,360
Body indicates, you know like things in your body, right?

380
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Yeah, I'm all nervous from lack of I'm a

381
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:38,480
Okay, okay. Oh, yeah, I like this song nice. Okay. Oh, where was I reading super chats back to super chats?

382
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,840
Pick a right thing here. Oh, that would be cool. I need toe. Thank you. It is named on sites with fuse old for six times

383
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
zoom, oh

384
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
I want to play more fuse

385
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:00,560
Is the season starting again soon on apex? Maybe I'll give it the good old try

386
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
I'll try hard

387
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
We'll see I

388
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,880
Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it

389
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:22,960
It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch

390
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,960
It takes less time. Well, I don't know

391
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,440
I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex

392
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,240
Maybe it's not that much time

393
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,520
But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die

394
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though

395
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Hmm

396
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:57,800
Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something

397
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,120
Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob

398
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,160
Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh

399
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Okay

400
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240

Because I had 100 vbucks in one account and then I had 550 vbucks in the other account

507
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,640
And I was like, oh maybe just on one account you start with like 100 vbucks or something or I earned that

508
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,640
So I was like, you know, do you have any vbucks?

509
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,040
It's funny it made yeah, it sounds like a mom. I want vbucks. Give me vbucks

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,320

Gold name means they have a victory crown if you pick one up and get a victory royale

529
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
It's supposed to be better than a regular royale

530
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
Huh

531
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
I don't know what this means

532
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,400

Sorry, it's because I have it saved. Oh my god, it's so loud. Sorry

00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,420
There's like different mic profiles in the go xlr, uh

558
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:19,340
In the go xlr thingy a program

559
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:29,260
And uh, every time I reset the program it keeps singing that I have my mic

560
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,260
You

00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,260

Music?

568
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,100
What, can you guys hear it?

569
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,100
No, you can't, right?

570
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,860
Music?

571
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,700
No.

572
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,100
You guys didn't hear anything.

573
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,660
Okay, it's only for a second.

574
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,740
Yeah, we'll be fine.

575
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,960
Test.

576
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,800
Test.

577
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,260
Okay, does it sound better now?

578
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,900
Okay.

579
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,360
I think there's just some weird discrepancy

580
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,640
between the hardware and the software.

581
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,780
Wait, does it work now?

582
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,980
Super Chat!

583
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,660
Thank you!

584
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,020
Okay, I think it's because I had my PC on,

585
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,300
but sometimes I like disconnect the GoXLR or something.

586
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,420
Or, Henry disconnects it.

587
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,700
Okay.

588
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,520
I'm gonna fix something.

589
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,220
Test.

590
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,660
No, no, no, no, no.

591
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,540
Take me to the eye of your mind.

592
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:12,540
Don't you know you might find a better place to play?

593
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,660
Okay.

594
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,660
I'm smart boy, thank you.

595
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,360
Small Amet earned her trucking license fair and square.

596
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,420
Very good, thank you.

597
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,320
I could be gonna know, thank you.

598
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,320
Hey, she said the things I had went to my head.

599
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,840
I've been back with someone down in New York.

600
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,600
Stand up beside the bonfire,

601
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,440
and then look from up your face.

602
01:00:50,440 --> 01:01:01,440
You ain't ever going to burn my heart out.

603
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,860
Thank you, but correct, thank you.

604
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,560
Small Amet caused a multitude of accidents

605
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,560
on that fateful day.

606
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,120
What is that, thank you.

607
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,720
Tenet, thank you.

608
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,660
A stratify, thank you.

609
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,260
Did you ever watch World Star Bites?

610
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,520
Oh, is that like where you go, oh World Star, World Star.

611
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,840
I've seen a few of those.

612
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,580
Oh, isn't there like really messed up stuff though, too?

613
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,760
Amet, thank you.

614
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,140
Oh, thank you for your dedication, Amet, thank you.

615
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,720
Nobody knows if it's night or day.

616
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,560
Oh, wow.

617
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,640
Mess me up, thank you.

618
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,140
This is the start of revolution from my bed.

619
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,520
Cause she said the things I had went to my head.

620
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,920
Small Amet's gonna drive a truck,

621
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,880
she's too small to see through the windshield.

622
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,240
Yes, yes, no, Small Amet had a booster seat.

623
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,240
Yeah, it was okay.

624
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,000
Take that look from off your face.

625
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
See, you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out.

626
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:37,120
And some girl we can't wait.

627
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,280
She knows it's too late.

628
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,280
Well, yeah, go to side, oh, thank you.

629
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,000
Thank you, Small Amet, cause you reached the pedal.

630
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,640
I think she had some sort of set up where she had like a peg

631
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,800
leg kind of strapped to one of her legs.

632
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,040
A pickle rig, thank you.

633
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,840
Instead of please step on me, Amet,

634
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,680
please run me over, Small Amet.

635
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,320
Yeah, must yes, thank you.

636
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,960
I'm sorry, it'd be an honor to be is a kind by these Small Amet.

637
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,240
All right, dear, thank you.

638
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,920
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

639
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,920
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

640
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,480
So Kelly can wait.

641
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,480
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by.

642
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,920
Her soul slides away.

643
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:52,680
And I'll look back and I'll go back to say.

644
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,040
Slow Tam, thank you, the Isekai Express, whoa, whoa.

645
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,520
Half wing, thank you.

646
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,600
Delorean truck, cool.

647
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,200
Bus, thank you.

648
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,520
Did you order some of the Omoket and Council Iris merch?

649
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,760
Which ones would you get?

650
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,960
I did, I got the main one.

651
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,800
And I think I got Mumei's,

652
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,560
because I liked how kind of subtle it was.

653
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,160
And then also Fauna's sweater.

654
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,160
And, oh, that was cool.

655
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,000
I get it for free.

656
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,200
I don't order Mumei's birthday merch.

657
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,880
I think I'm, I think I'm done ordering people's merch,

658
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,440
because I always forget.

659
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,800
It always, well, I get like a ton of emails

660
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,760
from before the haul.

661
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,560
Does that still happen with the Hololive shop

662
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,720
where if you order merch, like it gives you an email

663
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,080
and it's like, it's at a warehouse.

664
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,560
Please pay, blah, blah, blah, blah.

665
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,560
And I'm just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

666
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,560
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

667
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, Fauna's sweater is so cute.

668
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,000
Not from the official store.

669
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,440
Okay, because I have a ton of stuff that I got from Byee

670
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,440
and it was, well, they have extras now, I guess.

671
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,080
I mean, it's still mine, it's so, you know,

672
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,480
I just like supported them, I guess.

673
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,160
I just never got the item.

674
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,160
Ah, ah, ah.

675
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,960
Magic, magic.

676
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,560
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

677
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,640
Oh, is this a sign, you guys want me to sing this song

678
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,480
for karaoke?

679
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,600
Magic.

680
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,360
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

681
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,880
It's magic, magic.

682
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,840
I can't read, it's too small.

683
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,240
All I have to do is think of you

684
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:04,000
to make the music start to play.

685
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,520
Then I dance from down the street and I'm, I can't read.

686
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,920
Hey, hey, hey, magic ways.

687
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,080
Ooh, you love the girl with magic ways.

688
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,240
And it's true.

689
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,600
Oh, I can't read, it's too small.

690
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,880
The text is too small, I'm struggling here.

691
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,720
Okay.

692
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:36,720
Night and night and oh, sweet magic ways.

693
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:39,920
Oh, where was I?

694
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,880
Oh, Ricardo, thank you.

695
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,720
Oh, Reginald, thank you.

696
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,720
Oh, I want to translate this one.

697
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,240
Magic, magic.

698
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,240
Thank you, thank you, thank you profile, so cute.

699
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,360
Must be my new YouTube, I want to say Yo YouTube.

700
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,280
My new YouTube profile picture, thank you.

701
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,320
I think that it was the, well,

702
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,720
I was just like looking through Pixel

703
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,520
and I was trying so many different pictures

704
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,040
and like it's just that, you know,

705
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,840
having blonde hair and being super pale,

706
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,280
it's kind of hard with contrast,

707
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,920
like to find a good image that contrasts properly

708
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,520
for like a small profile picture.

709
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,680
So I was just Googling my name

710
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,400
and looking through the images and I found this one

711
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,160
and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images

712
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,080
I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.

713
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,880
So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.

714
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,360
So I decided to keep it.

715
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,160
Magic, magic.

716
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,600
Oh, right dude, thank you.

717
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,600
Yuste, kam samita.

718
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,160
I ate Amaz menu at a collaboration cafe yesterday.

719
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,200
It was really good.

720
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,520
Hope there'll be more events like this next time.

721
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,680
Oh, thank you, kam samita, kam amo yo.

722
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,800
Yeah, about the cafe in Korea.

723
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,480
And yeah, I saw like what Kyara shared,

724
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,280
like some pictures of some very dedicated

725
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,600
Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,

726
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,840
like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.

727
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,360
I think they were camping out like at midnight,

728
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,280
waiting for it to open

729
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,320
because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.

730
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,560
So take some dedication, you know.

731
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,960
It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout

732
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,560
for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.

733
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah, they're very dedicated

734
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,200
and they seem really happy too.

735
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,200
I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.

736
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,040
It'd be awesome.

737
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,960
Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,

738
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,360
but still.

739
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,200
Yeah, that's true.

740
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,560
They keep underestimating us.

741
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,520
When will they learn?

742
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,160
Psycho, thank you.

743
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,280
Oh, some coins, thank you.

744
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,840
Pick a ring, thank you.

745
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,920
Oh yeah, I saw.

746
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,400
Was there like for real GTA six announcement?

747
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,200
Or was it like a leak or something?

748
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,720
I'm ending things, I know.

749
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,720
Oh, it's real.

750
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,520
They're working on it.

751
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,960
Didn't it take like 10 years for GTA five

752
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,880
or some like really long amount?

753
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,520
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

754
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,920
Cool, I definitely played GTA six

755
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:01,920
when it comes out in four years.

756
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,480
Storm blade, thank you.

757
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,080
I believe Smulama did isekai some people on that.

758
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,640
Faithful day.

759
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,640
Storm, oh wait, right next, thank you.

760
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,720
YouTube crashed again, thank you.

761
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:22,720
I'm gonna get a close chat.

762
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,160
All right.

763
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:40,160
Where was I?

764
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

765
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

766
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,160
Thank you, the song is distracting.

767
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,160
TK, thank you.

768
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,160
Can you say I'm saying thank you?

769
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,160
Reindeer, thank you.

770
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
I'm a reed.

771
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,160
Thank you, some, oh, attack a goalie, thank you.

772
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,160
I almost said Smulama.

773
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,160
Yeah, investigators meeting, uh-huh, uh-huh.

774
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,160
Thank you for the support.

775
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,160
I didn't go, we didn't go, thank you.

776
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,160
Are we there yet?

777
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,160
I have to use the bathroom.

778
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,160
Bubba hit me, it's too hot.

779
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,160
Can we get McDonald's over there yet?

780
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,160
Shut up.

781
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,160
Aw, cute.

782
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,160
A new song, arigato.

783
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,160
Yejun, thank you.

784
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:36,160
Last time someone drew a picture of Smulama standing outside the big truck

785
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,160
fighting a piece of wheat straw,

786
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,160
does Smulama want to find someone's mother again?

787
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,160
Smulama's got a whole phone book,

788
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,160
whole of, uh, you know,

789
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,160
you know, uh, victims, nah, nah, nah.

790
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,160
Friends.

791
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,160
Smulama's got a lot of friends.

792
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,160
Or to the, thank you.

793
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,160
Thank you.

794
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,160
Halfwayang, thank you.

795
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,160
Yeah, GTA 5, the Europe map DLC.

796
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,160
Can I say I'm saying cute?

797
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,160
Taro Cube, saying cute.

798
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,160
Maybe trucker Smulama's license from the wrong timeline.

799
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,160
Yeah, I think so.

800
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,160
Yeah, it's not very valid here.

801
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,160
Airbumble, thank you.

802
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,160
Pickle Rick times two, thank you.

803
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,160
Boss music in Eurotrucks.

804
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,160
I guess there was as we were parking.

805
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,160
We have a day, thank you.

806
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,160
I'm glad you enjoyed the stream, thank you.

807
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,160
Thank you.

808
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,160
Thank you.

809
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,160
Yeah, everybody left the factory,

810
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,160
the carrot factory as Smulama was trying to deliver.

811
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,160
I guess it would be the, I don't know, processing plant maybe.

812
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,160
Uh-huh.

813
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:57,160
Damn, you could fit a lot of carrots in like a 22-foot long truck, huh?

814
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,160
Like tons and tons of carrots.

815
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,160
Whoa.

816
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,160
Okay, thank you.

817
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,160
This is harder than me landing on a sun station or parking a truck.

818
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,160
The sun station took way longer.

819
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,160
Mila, what's up, Detective Extraordinaire, thank you.

820
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,160
Hey, Solasos, thank you.

821
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,160
Wouldn't it be cool if truck sim had a Fallout mod?

822
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,160
It sounds very specific.

823
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:32,160
I guess it'd be more believable if Fallout had a truck sim mod.

824
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,160
Uh, Amadeus, thank you.

825
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,160
Hidezuki, thank you.

826
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,160
By color, thank you.

827
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:48,160
Up a creek, thank you.

828
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:53,160
Yeah, I'll just get a real truck and see how it is, how it really is.

829
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,160
Uh, Dunlides, thank you.

830
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,160
Uh, Slotham, thank you.

831
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,160
Nice boat, thank you.

832
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,160
Isute, Kamsamita.

833
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:14,160
Wait, is this what it says? Let me double check.

834
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,160
Okay, Multi, thank you.

835
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,160
Wajaleo, thank you.

836
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,160
Twilight, thank you.

837
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,160
Fishstar, thank you.

838
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:35,160
Alright, only about 20% left of the superchets, including the ones from the stream.

839
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,160
Itchy.

840
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,160
Hold on.

841
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:50,160
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

842
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,160
It's a guy's simulator, I like that.

843
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,160
Uh, Rekukun, thank you.

844
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,160
Um, A screen, thank you.

845
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,160
Truckson.

846
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,160
Can I say it? So thank you.

847
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,160
Thank you for watching.

848
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,160
Kamsamita.

849
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,160
Kamsamita.

850
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,160
Jiho, komawa yo.

851
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:21,160
Mayscreen, thank you.

852
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,160
Aw, thank you.

853
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,160
Kuristai, thank you.

854
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,160
Alright, now superchets from two days ago. What did we do two days ago?

855
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,160
Oh, wait, is this from the free chat? Oh, no.

856
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:35,160
Okay, I guess there's some from the free chat and then some from the today stream.

857
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,160
Kuristai, thank you.

858
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,160
Oh, Rekukun, thank you.

859
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
I'm at Crunchyroll Expo for the next two days.

860
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,160
I'll be the vlogging. Oh, nice.

861
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,160
Did I stream? I don't remember.

862
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,160
Just in time, thank you.

863
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
I hope you enjoyed the convention.

864
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
Oh, karaoke.

865
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,160
Rekukun, thank you.

866
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,160
Oh, oh, yes.

867
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,160
It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,

868
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:06,160
but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,

869
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,160
I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,

870
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:13,160
close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert

871
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:17,160
and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short

872
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:21,160
because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.

873
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,160
Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?

874
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,160
Aw, cool.

875
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,160
Yeah, it was really cool.

876
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:36,160
I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,

877
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,160
so her voice was not that great.

878
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,160
She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,

879
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,160
so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,

880
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:48,160
but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,

881
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,160
it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?

882
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,160
And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.

883
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,160
It's so cool.

884
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,160
Mm-hmm, so magical.

885
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,160
Aw, where was I?

886
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:12,160
Aw, I made me a thank you.

887
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,160
How was it to meet some of your fans?

888
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:20,160
I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,

889
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:25,160
so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,

890
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,160
well, how was your convention going?

891
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,160
Did you see the KFP stand?

892
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,160
I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?

893
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,160
Did you see the Artist Alley?

894
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,160
How many did I meet?

895
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,160
I think, I don't know the exact number,

896
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,160
but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.

897
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,160
I think a little bit more than 20.

898
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,160
Aw, okay, good, thank you.

899
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:55,160
I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.

900
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,160
Good, it's a bad influence.

901
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,160
Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.

902
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,160
It was just some guy in the crowd.

903
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,160
Ms. Mint, thank you.

904
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:07,160
Yeah, we made a thank you.

905
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,160
Can I ask about the coin purse?

906
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,160
It's super cute and I want one.

907
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:16,160
I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,

908
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,160
like a long time ago.

909
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,160
Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.

910
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,160
Pickle Rick, thank you.

911
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,160
Next meeting greets, yeah.

912
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,160
I wouldn't mind doing them as often.

913
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,160
This is convention season still right now,

914
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,160
but during convention season I don't mind doing it.

915
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,160
It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.

916
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,160
I think doing the panel was more difficult

917
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,160
than doing the meeting greets because,

918
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,160
well, usually in the past when we do panels,

919
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,160
there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC

920
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,160
who deals with handling the crowd

921
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,160
and asking questions and things like that

922
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,160
and just keeping the flow going for the panel,

923
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,160
but because it was up to each of us,

924
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,160
Good and I were talking about different ideas

925
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,160
that we could do for the panel,

926
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,160
and we just didn't come to a conclusion

927
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,160
of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.

928
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:16,160
I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,

929
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:21,160
and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.

930
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,160
So we had a lot of ideas,

931
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:28,160
but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,

932
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,160
like, oh, just, you know, questions.

933
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,160
MeTuber support, okay.

934
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,160
It was easy.

935
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,160
And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,

936
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,160
so I really wanted to, you know,

937
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:44,160
work with that too and do a little musical thing.

938
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:48,160
Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.

939
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:51,160
I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.

940
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,160
If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.

941
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,160
If I could even get that effect in OBS,

942
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,160
which it kind of worked.

943
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,160
I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.

944
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,160
I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.

945
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:09,160
But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll

946
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,160
if we could hand out.

947
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,160
I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.

948
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:17,160
If we could hand out like blue and red,

949
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,160
those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,

950
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:24,160
something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.

951
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,160
I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.

952
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,160
You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.

953
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,160
But I think it was too last minute anyways.

954
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,160
Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.

955
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,160
I don't even know how that would be possible.

956
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,160
I know you can rent 3D glasses.

957
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,160
You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,

958
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,160
but those work differently.

959
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,160
It's like it takes...

960
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,160
Hmm.

961
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:56,160
I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.

962
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,160
It like polarizes light circularly.

963
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,160
And so what it is, is like when you're watching

964
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,160
one of those 3D movies in theaters,

965
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,160
is they have like two projectors going,

966
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,160
or one that switches really fast back and forth,

967
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,160
and they're polarized.

968
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,160
Circularly polarized in opposite directions,

969
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:20,160
and each lens only allows one directional,

970
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,160
one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.

971
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,160
I think I get it.

972
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,160
Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.

973
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:30,160
Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.

974
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:34,160
Unless we had a special projector.

975
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,160
It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.

976
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,160
How do they work?

977
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,160
Um...

978
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,160
Okay, yeah, light wave physics.

979
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,160
It was interesting watching.

980
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,160
I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,

981
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,160
but this is like pretty complicated.

982
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,160
They like talking about, you know, the light waves

983
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:57,160
and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.

984
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:02,160
And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.

985
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,160
I don't even think I took a physics class.

986
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,160
Oh, no.

987
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,160
I kind of took a physics class, yeah.

988
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,160
Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.

989
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,160
Two YouTube tutorials later.

990
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,160
How do magnets work?

991
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,160
I don't know, how do they work?

992
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:27,160
It's magic.

993
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,160
Um...

994
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,160
Let's see.

995
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:35,160
Where was I?

996
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:41,160
Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.

997
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:45,160
Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,

998
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,160
I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,

999
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,160
I guess it sort of implied there might be something else

1000
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,160
coming up soon, so I don't know.

1001
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:56,160
I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,

1002
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,160
it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,

1003
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,160
but I'm not sure yet.

1004
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:08,160
Uh, no confirmations yet.

1005
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:12,160
Uh, Vercatos, thank you.

1006
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,160
Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.

1007
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,160
My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember

1008
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,160
some of the anime that I really liked.

1009
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,160
So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked

1010
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,160
and that I remembered that I liked,

1011
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,160
but I think there's some anime that I really liked too

1012
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:31,160
that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.

1013
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:34,160
Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?

1014
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,160
Congratulations!

1015
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,160
A marriage, whoa!

1016
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,160
Nice, thank you for the support.

1017
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:44,160
I hope they have a successful marriage.

1018
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,160
Marriage.

1019
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,160
SS109, thank you.

1020
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,160
Picoric, thank you.

1021
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,160
Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?

1022
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:57,160
Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.

1023
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:03,160
It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.

1024
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,160
Um...

1025
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:13,160
Amidoko kamsamita!

1026
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,160
Ah, come on way up.

1027
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,160
Fates, thank you.

1028
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,160
Yo, yo, yo.

1029
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,160
I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.

1030
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,160
Amazing sand, thank you.

1031
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,160
Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing

1032
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,160
for next year's Crunchyroll convention,

1033
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,160
but it did seem like a lot of fun,

1034
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,160
especially I just tweeted something before the stream.

1035
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:33,160
Everybody's like, ame, ame.

1036
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,160
And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.

1037
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:41,160
A small ame was there dancing.

1038
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,160
Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.

1039
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,160
Um, Mephi, thank you.

1040
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,160
It doesn't have to be, you know,

1041
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:55,160
only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.

1042
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,160
Um...

1043
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,160
Um, Mephi, thank you.

1044
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,160
Super Sunday time.

1045
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,160
Stratus fight, thank you.

1046
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,160
Immediates, thank you.

1047
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,160
Bus, thank you.

1048
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,160
You can get a degree at the panel the other day.

1049
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,160
Thanks so well.

1050
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,160
How different was it singing

1051
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,160
and being able to watch the crowd?

1052
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,160
Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...

1053
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:24,160
Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,

1054
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,160
I wasn't watching the crowd

1055
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:30,160
because I was looking at the lyrics.

1056
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,160
But, um, yeah, like I said,

1057
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,160
watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.

1058
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,160
Mm-hmm.

1059
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,160
And Smart Boy, thank you.

1060
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,160
Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.

1061
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,160
Puru put it in at this point.

1062
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,160
But you just don't know.

1063
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:49,160
I just wanted to make sure I got it right.

1064
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.

1065
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,160
That'd be cool.

1066
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,160
Uh, EricW1, thank you.

1067
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,160
Tried making amine last night.

1068
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,160
It tasted pretty good.

1069
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,160
Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.

1070
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,160
I'm glad you liked it.

1071
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:06,160
Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.

1072
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,160
Aww.

1073
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,160
Oh, thank you.

1074
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,160
Thank you for the question.

1075
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,160
I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.

1076
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,160
I-R-L.

1077
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,160
Mm-hmm.

1078
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,160
Yeah, I'm done.

1079
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,160
Mm-hmm.

1080
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,160
Yesterday, I got something to do.

1081
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,160
This song sounds...

1082
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,160
This song sounds kind of sad.

1083
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:32,160
But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.

1084
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:38,160
Alpha 9 5 7 1.

1085
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,160
Ooh.

1086
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,160
Cool.

1087
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,160
Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.

1088
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:52,160
Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.

1089
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,160
Thank you.

1090
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,160
Thank you.

1091
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:01,160
Thank you.

1092
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,160
Aww, thank you.

1093
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,160
I'm glad you enjoyed.

1094
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,160
Wait.

1095
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,160
Thank you.

1096
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,160
I'll see you laughing.

1097
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,160
Thank you.

1098
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,160
Ask Pei.

1099
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,160
Thank you.

1100
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:13,160
Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?

1101
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,160
Maybe, perhaps?

1102
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:16,160
Uh, I think it's an affiliate.

1103
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:20,160
I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.

1104
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:25,160
Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.

1105
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,160
So, I'll, uh, get started on that.

1106
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,160
Mm-hmm.

1107
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:35,160
Ifmefa, thank you.

1108
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,160
Oh.

1109
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,160
Aww, thank you.

1110
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,160
Aww, thank you.

1111
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,160
Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.

1112
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,160
Esta ludos desde Chile.

1113
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,160
Oh, Chile.

1114
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,160
Very chill.

1115
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,160
Muchas gracias.

1116
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,160
Anti-whippy, thank you.

1117
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:02,160
It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.

1118
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,160
She even became Ian's old mascot.

1119
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:11,160
You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?

1120
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
Oh.

1121
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,160
Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.

1122
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:22,160
I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.

1123
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:29,160
So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.

1124
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:34,160
You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.

1125
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,160
So, yeah.

1126
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:41,160
But, yeah, it is really crazy.

1127
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,160
It is surprising.

1128
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:50,160
But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,

1129
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,160
and people started using them in memes.

1130
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:58,160
So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.

1131
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:02,160
She's, like, 40 now.

1132
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,160
Small Aime is the real idol here.

1133
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,160
Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.

1134
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,160
What do you guys think?

1135
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,160
Oh, there's an idea.

1136
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,160
Hey, I can do it on my own.

1137
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,160
Well, not all alone, but...

1138
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,160
Huh.

1139
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:28,160
All right, well, stay tuned.

1140
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:34,160
Flynn Playmable, thank you.

1141
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,160
Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.

1142
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,160
TK, thank you.

1143
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:42,160
First, Akka Super Chat.

1144
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,160
Oh, that was a solid one.

1145
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:49,160
Thank you so much, TK.

1146
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:53,160
Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.

1147
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:59,160
Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.

1148
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,160
Thank you.

1149
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:05,160
At TotoCubes, thank you.

1150
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,160
Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?

1151
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:11,160
Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.

1152
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,160
Me too.

1153
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,160
Last time, 39. Thank you.

1154
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,160
The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.

1155
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,160
It looks so good.

1156
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:23,160
Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.

1157
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:28,160
Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?

1158
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,160
Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...

1159
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:36,160
Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.

1160
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,160
Right next, thank you.

1161
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:41,160
Does Mama get put back in the box?

1162
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:48,160
Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.

1163
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:52,160
I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?

1164
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:56,160
At TK, thank you.

1165
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:02,160
Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.

1166
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,160
Aw.

1167
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,160
Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.

1168
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,160
I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.

1169
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,160
Thank you, thank you for the support.

1170
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,160
Thank you.

1171
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:20,160
Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.

1172
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,160
I'm in it all night.

1173
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:26,160
Rock the gas bar. Rock the...

1174
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,160
Lock the taskbar.

1175
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,160
All right, dear. Thank you.

1176
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,160
Yeah.

1177
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:38,160
It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...

1178
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,160
You know, I think she's getting better.

1179
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,160
I think she's improving a little bit.

1180
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,160
Uh, Lynn, thank you.

1181
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:49,160
YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.

1182
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,160
There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,

1183
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,160
and even has a shark egg.

1184
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:57,160
Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,

1185
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,160
fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.

1186
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,160
Watch me put them in.

1187
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,160
And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,

1188
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,160
what's up, fish heads?

1189
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:10,160
And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.

1190
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,160
And it's not even that cool when you see it.

1191
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,160
I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...

1192
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,160
They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,

1193
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,160
really high-quality videos of their tanks.

1194
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,160
And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,

1195
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,160
and there's, like, relaxing music, so...

1196
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,160
That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.

1197
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,160
Uh, Kram, thank you so much!

1198
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:36,160
Another big substitute!

1199
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,160
It just says,

1200
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,160
I'm in!

1201
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,160
Thank you so much for the support.

1202
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:49,160
TK, the third big super check!

1203
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,160
Thank you so much!

1204
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:54,160
Huh?

1205
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,160
Aww, thank you, TK.

1206
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,160
So sweet!

1207
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,160
I see another one here, but TK, again.

1208
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,160
Here, look, he's always so fun.

1209
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,160
Game streams, always entertaining.

1210
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,160
Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,

1211
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,160
but his stream is so comfy,

1212
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,160
and video stream projects always spark excitement.

1213
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,160
Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1214
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1215
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,160
So sweet!

1216
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,160
Thank you so much!

1217
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,160
I really appreciate it.

1218
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,160
I'm glad, uh, you know,

1219
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:20,160
at the end of the day,

1220
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:23,160
if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,

1221
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,160
I'm happy, so thank you.

1222
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:29,160
And Majin D, thank you!

1223
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,160
Majin 8, thank you!

1224
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,160
I'll see you in the bar!

1225
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,160
Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,

1226
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,160
I hope you get there safe.

1227
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,160
I hope you win the lottery one day for the...

1228
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,160
not just the regular lottery,

1229
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,160
the main green lottery, I guess.

1230
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,160
Uh, right here!

1231
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,160
Thank you!

1232
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,160
Endless Ame!

1233
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:51,160
Only around Halloween.

1234
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:55,160
Rock the guest box!

1235
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:59,160
Ame, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee!

1236
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:02,160
Uh, Roger Liao, thank you!

1237
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,160
Ame, ame, ame, ame, ame!

1238
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,160
A12 Flames.

1239
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,160
Thank you!

1240
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,160
Oh!

1241
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,160
Oh, the deep skies nuts!

1242
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,160
Yeah, that was a tweet that I read during the panel.

1243
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,160
Thank you for the question!

1244
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,160
Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!

1245
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,160
Oh my god, this song is really loud.

1246
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:26,160
Okay.

1247
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,160
Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.

1248
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,160
Uh, where was I?

1249
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,160
Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!

1250
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,160
Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.

1251
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,160
Uh-huh.

1252
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:44,160
Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!

1253
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,160
Oh!

1254
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,160
Uh, thank you so much!

1255
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,160
Thank you!

1256
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,160
I hope you also have a yummy food!

1257
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,160
Mm-hmm!

1258
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,160
Thank you so much for all the support.

1259
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,160
I appreciate it.

1260
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,160
Nagi!

1261
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,160
Oh, thank you!

1262
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,160
Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!

1263
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,160
Oh, it was really sweet!

1264
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,160
Thank you so much!

1265
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,160
Nagi's so cute!

1266
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,160
So cute!

1267
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:13,160
Yeah, we got some pictures together.

1268
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,160
Thank you, thank you for all your support.

1269
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,160
I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.

1270
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,160
Thank you!

1271
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:24,160
So many cute teammates!

1272
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,160
Thank you!

1273
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:32,160
Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.

1274
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,160
Did I have any input for the figure?

1275
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:42,160
Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,

1276
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:49,160
but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.

1277
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,160
I think it was for that one.

1278
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:53,160
Mm-hmm.

1279
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,160
Aaron Pampo, thank you!

1280
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:58,160
Happy birthday!

1281
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:03,160
This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.

1282
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,160
Ooh, an amé party!

1283
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,160
Dang, amé cake!

1284
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,160
Amé day!

1285
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,160
No, just kidding.

1286
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,160
I hope the cake was tasty.

1287
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:16,160
I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.

1288
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,160
Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!

1289
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,160
I hope you have a good rest of the day.

1290
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,160
Night!

1291
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,160
Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?

1292
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,160
Amé cake?

1293
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,160
Mm-hmm, amé party!

1294
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,160
Very cool.

1295
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,160
A flag armor, thank you!

1296
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,160
I'll be out of blackberries!

1297
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,160
No, no, they're still on the...

1298
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:39,160
They left them on the counter, they're still there!

1299
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,160
Eduardo, thank you!

1300
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,160
Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.

1301
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,160
Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?

1302
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,160
Did I say that?

1303
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,160
Oh...

1304
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,160
I don't remember.

1305
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,160
Uh...

1306
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,160
Yes, just assume that...

1307
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:56,160
Yes, uh-huh.

1308
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,160
I could be at 9-9, thank you!

1309
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,160
Um, many times, thank you!

1310
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,160
Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,

1311
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,160
because, you know, the people around you,

1312
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:10,160
if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,

1313
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:14,160
but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,

1314
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,160
at least have heard of it.

1315
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,160
Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,

1316
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:22,160
so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.

1317
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,160
Mm-hmm!

1318
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,160
Xinyoung-ho!

1319
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:35,160
Thank you!

1320
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:40,160
Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!

1321
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,160
Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,

1322
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,160
aim for 22 games in 2022?

1323
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,160
How many do I need left?

1324
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,160
How many left are there that I need to complete?

1325
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,160
I think it's possible, what?

1326
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,160
How many months?

1327
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,160
We still have 5 months.

1328
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:57,160
I think it's possible.

1329
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,160
20 more to go! 19?

1330
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,160
Well, I have some shorter games.

1331
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:05,160
Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,

1332
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,160
that I think we could do.

1333
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:12,160
But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,

1334
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:15,160
and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,

1335
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:19,160
Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.

1336
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,160
I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.

1337
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,160
And I know, um,

1338
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,160
there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,

1339
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,160
but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,

1340
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:36,160
and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,

1341
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,160
and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,

1342
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:42,160
like a platform or something, like a 2D.

1343
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:45,160
Ooh, I did want to play, um...

1344
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:49,160
Hey!

1345
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,160
What was that one game?

1346
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,160
I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.

1347
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,160
Uh...

1348
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,160
Crash Bandicoot!

1349
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,160
Yeah, I'm gonna play.

1350
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,160
Stray? I don't know, it looks...

1351
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,160
It looks cute, but I don't know.

1352
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:11,160
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

1353
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:15,160
Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...

1354
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,160
Switch?

1355
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,160
Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,

1356
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,160
I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,

1357
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,160
it seems like a game that would take me a while.

1358
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,160
Uh...

1359
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,160
It is?

1360
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:39,160
Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?

1361
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,160
We'll see.

1362
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:48,160
Uh, Multi, thank you.

1363
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,160
Aww...

1364
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,160
Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.

1365
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:56,160
Mm-hmm.

1366
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,160
Uh, EricW1, thank you.

1367
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,160
Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity

1368
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:03,160
to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.

1369
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,160
Mm-hmm.

1370
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,160
Anyways, thank you.

1371
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:14,160
Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.

1372
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,160
I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.

1373
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,160
Have a snack.

1374
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,160
Maybe I'll make a sandwich.

1375
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:25,160
Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.

1376
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,160
Um, what do you mean, what?

1377
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,160
Huh?

1378
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:31,160
Go to start, thank you.

1379
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:36,160
Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.

1380
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,160
Agent Quirobo, thank you.

1381
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:40,160
Gracias.

1382
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,160
Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.

1383
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,160
Would there be a post for the schedule this week?

1384
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,160
Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.

1385
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,160
I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.

1386
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:50,160
Mm-hmm.

1387
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,160
I think I will post something.

1388
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,160
I don't know yet.

1389
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:58,160
If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,

1390
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:00,160
like 24 hours before.

1391
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,160
Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.

1392
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,160
Mm-hmm.

1393
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,160
Semen 2016, oh, thank you.

1394
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,160
I hope you're having a good day too.

1395
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:12,160
Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed

1396
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:16,160
the Eurotruck sim stream.

1397
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,160
You mean?

1398
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,160
Yasami-ka!

1399
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,160
Thank you.

1400
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,160
Antipi, thank you.

1401
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:27,160
Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays

1402
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,160
might be a good way to help fill out the week.

1403
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,160
Possibly.

1404
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,160
That is true.

1405
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:35,160
Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.

1406
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:37,160
I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.

1407
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,160
I keep forgetting.

1408
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,160
Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.

1409
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,160
It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams

1410
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,160
that I've done on there, and I will upload them there

1411
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:50,160
for archive reasons.

1412
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,160
Archival, is that a word?

1413
01:41:54,160 --> 01:42:00,160
Uh...

1414
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:04,160
Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?

1415
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:07,160
No, Bart, thank you.

1416
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,160
Where's Super Chat?

1417
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,160
Sorry, we do pops here.

1418
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,160
I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it

1419
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:16,160
like a, say something bad or something.

1420
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:19,160
Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.

1421
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,160
Twitch sucks!

1422
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:25,160
Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective

1423
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,160
good to stream every now and then.

1424
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,160
Okay, like imagine this.

1425
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:31,160
Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,

1426
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:34,160
and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.

1427
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,160
Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.

1428
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:39,160
Now, of course there's discoverability,

1429
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,160
you know, possible within YouTube,

1430
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:45,160
and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,

1431
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,160
our whole audience is on YouTube.

1432
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:51,160
But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,

1433
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:55,160
a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,

1434
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:57,160
okay, you could have one person

1435
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,160
streaming their perspective on Twitch,

1436
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:05,160
and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.

1437
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,160
That's business, baby!

1438
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,160
But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming

1439
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,160
like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,

1440
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,160
it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,

1441
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:20,160
I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.

1442
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,160
I don't know.

1443
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,160
Maybe it's just all in my head.

1444
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:27,160
I gotta check the statistics.

1445
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,160
Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.

1446
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,160
How about that?

1447
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,160
What was the other one?

1448
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,160
Video motion.

1449
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,160
Thank you.

1450
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:42,160
Thank you.

1451
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,160
Oh, gracias.

1452
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:47,160
The motherfucking workers, thank you.

1453
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:49,160
Nanji Misa, arigato.

1454
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,160
Ame-chan, kawaii.

1455
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,160
Thank you.

1456
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,160
Arigato.

1457
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,160
Shadowfire, thank you.

1458
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:02,160
Oh, muchas gracias.

1459
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,160
Nice.

1460
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,160
Ellen Saputro.

1461
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,160
Thank you.

1462
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,160
Oh, Arowanas.

1463
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,160
Yeah, they look cool.

1464
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:13,160
I like them when they're small, when they're babies,

1465
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,160
but Arowana is a type of fish.

1466
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,160
They get big.

1467
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,160
They get really big, and they'll bite you,

1468
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,160
and you can bleed and stuff.

1469
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:24,160
It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank

1470
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:28,160
for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.

1471
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,160
Boi-boo, boi-boo.

1472
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:35,160
They're so cute when they're small,

1473
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:38,160
because their eyes are really big.

1474
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,160
Let me see if I can show a picture.

1475
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,160
Whoa, what is this?

1476
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,160
They have this sack.

1477
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,160
A weird sack.

1478
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,160
What is this weird sack that they have?

1479
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,160
I'll show you this picture.

1480
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,160
Oh, see, they're so cute.

1481
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:13,160
Yeah, they're expensive.

1482
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,160
See, they have this little weird sack.

1483
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,160
Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?

1484
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,160
Because it looks like only the babies have them.

1485
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:29,160
What is that?

1486
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,160
They're born with it?

1487
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:36,160
A digestion sack?

1488
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,160
Yeah, they get really big, though.

1489
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:42,160
Let's see, fully grown.

1490
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,160
Here.

1491
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:53,160
Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.

1492
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,160
This is good for perspective.

1493
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,160
I don't know who that is,

1494
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:00,160
but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.

1495
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,160
Wait, this looks like Photoshop.

1496
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,160
No, it's not real.

1497
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,160
It's a clickbait image.

1498
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,160
They're not that big.

1499
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:14,160
Let's see if I can find a better picture.

1500
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,160
Okay, this is a good one.

1501
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,160
Bim, bam, bim, bam.

1502
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,160
Oh, my God.

1503
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,160
Okay.

1504
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,160
Okay.

1505
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,160
Yeah.

1506
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,160
Yeah, they're cute.

1507
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,160
Cute, cute.

1508
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,160
Omega hot dog.

1509
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,160
Thank you.

1510
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:48,160
What do you call an omega that makes gluten-filled bread?

1511
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,160
A Watsonburg dishes baking bed.

1512
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,160
Ha, ha.

1513
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,160
Very funny.

1514
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,160
Oh, Julia, thank you.

1515
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,160
What?

1516
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,160
Halfway.

1517
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,160
Thank you.

1518
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,160
You done?

1519
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,160
Thank you.

1520
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,160
I saw a small omelet at this event.

1521
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,160
I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.

1522
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,160
Yago was also there.

1523
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,160
Didn't do anything to him, right?

1524
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:10,160
Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?

1525
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,160
Or since earlier today?

1526
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,160
Suss.

1527
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,160
Suss.

1528
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,160
Maka, thank you.

1529
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,160
This is a big super chat.

1530
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,160
If you don't remember backstaters,

1531
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:23,160
don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.

1532
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,160
Let me see.

1533
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:26,160
Grindings like neon white.

1534
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,160
Hmm?

1535
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,160
Yeah, we'll see.

1536
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,160
I just feel like for people watching,

1537
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:35,160
maybe it's like repetitive or something.

1538
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,160
I do think it is pretty fun, though.

1539
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,160
I don't really mind backstating neon white

1540
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,160
because I don't even look at chat

1541
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,160
unless I ask you guys a question.

1542
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,160
I'm sorry, boy.

1543
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,160
Thank you.

1544
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,160
Ryan, Quebec.

1545
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,160
Thank you.

1546
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,160
That's right.

1547
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,160
Investigators.

1548
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:52,160
No bathroom breaks.

1549
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,160
Investigator breaks only.

1550
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,160
Investigator meetings only.

1551
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:56,160
A look-in.

1552
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:58,160
Thank you.

1553
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:59,160
Huh?

1554
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:01,160
Okay.

1555
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,160
Face of motion.

1556
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,160
Thank you.

1557
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:05,160
Yeah.

1558
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:06,160
Bubble bot.

1559
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,160
MVP.

1560
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,160
Oh, what's it, Mila 5?

1561
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:13,160
Oh, 1527.

1562
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,160
Oh, thank you.

1563
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,160
Yes, I'll pick them up.

1564
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,160
Thank you.

1565
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,160
Lucky senpai.

1566
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,160
Thank you.

1567
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,160
Oh, at the meet and greet.

1568
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,160
Thank you for stopping by.

1569
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,160
Thank you for the super chat.

1570
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:24,160
I appreciate it.

1571
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,160
Thank you.

1572
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,160
Itsu-mo.

1573
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,160
Kamalaya.

1574
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,160
Is it itsu-mo?

1575
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:31,160
Is it like it always...

1576
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:33,160
It means like it's always or something?

1577
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,160
Always.

1578
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:37,160
AirW1, thank you.

1579
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:41,160
Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?

1580
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,160
Three fish got battered.

1581
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:46,160
Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?

1582
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,160
Oh, I like that one.

1583
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:50,160
That's a good one.

1584
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,160
Okay, P-back.

1585
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,160
I see.

1586
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,160
I see.

1587
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,160
Okay.

1588
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,160
Hi, Gavin Dorff.

1589
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:56,160
Thank you.

1590
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:59,160
I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.

1591
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,160
What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?

1592
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:07,160
I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.

1593
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:12,160
Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.

1594
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:13,160
Something like that?

1595
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,160
Oh, what are they called?

1596
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,160
Dragon?

1597
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,160
Dragon days?

1598
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,160
No.

1599
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,160
Sea dragons.

1600
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:20,160
Yeah, sea dragons.

1601
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:24,160
And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.

1602
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,160
Pipefish, I think?

1603
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:28,160
They're so cute.

1604
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,160
Oh, garden eels.

1605
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,160
Yeah, I like seeing those types.

1606
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:33,160
Seahorses especially.

1607
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:41,160
You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater

1608
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:48,160
person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses

1609
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:56,160
had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses

1610
01:49:56,160 --> 01:50:02,160
in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they

1611
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:09,160
give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue

1612
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:17,160
inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the

1613
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,880
tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.

1614
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:23,980
It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.

1615
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:27,960
So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the

1616
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:33,600
seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like

1617
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:39,920
where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels

1618
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,560
so that the seahorse can swim normally again.

1619
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:47,320
So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary

1620
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:48,320
to do.

1621
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:52,360
And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.

1622
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:53,360
Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.

1623
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,360
Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they

1624
01:50:56,360 --> 01:51:02,400
like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like

1625
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,520
a build up of gas.

1626
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:11,560
Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.

1627
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,560
Mm-hmm.

1628
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,560
It's scary.

1629
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:14,560
What does that happen to us?

1630
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,560
Maybe it does.

1631
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:16,560
All right.

1632
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:17,560
Hello, thank you.

1633
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,560
Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.

1634
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:19,560
Yeah, thank you.

1635
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:20,560
Happy early international cat day to Wellington Henry.

1636
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,560
Oh cute, what is that?

1637
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:22,560
International cat day tomorrow?

1638
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:23,560
There's too many, there's too many of these like weird holidays, internet holidays.

1639
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:24,560
Oh my gosh.

1640
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,560
Oh my gosh.

1641
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,560
Oh my gosh.

1642
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,560
Oh my gosh.

1643
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,560
Oh my gosh.

1644
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,560
Oh my gosh.

1645
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:30,560
Oh my gosh.

1646
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,560
Oh my gosh.

1647
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,560
Oh my gosh.

1648
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,560
Oh my gosh.

1649
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:34,560
Oh my gosh.

1650
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:42,560
What is that, international cat day tomorrow, there's too many of these like weird holidays,

1651
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,560
internet holidays.

1652
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,560
I'll make sure to give them a treat though.

1653
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,560
Epic work, thank you.

1654
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:46,560
Smalmed, we'll take over the world.

1655
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:47,560
That'll one, thank you.

1656
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,560
Can I hire Smalmed to come to my birthday party?

1657
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,560
That'd be funny.

1658
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,560
I'll keep them as a backup plan, yes.

1659
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,560
I'll tell Smalmed that could be a good backup plan.

1660
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:07,560
A Vtuber fan, thank you.

1661
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:15,560
Oh, shout out to, I don't know about that, but I really appreciate all the support to

1662
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:16,560
a Vtuber fan, thank you.

1663
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,560
Thank you.

1664
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:18,560
Thank you.

1665
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,560
Thank you.

1666
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,560
Thank you.

1667
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,560
You're my main inspiration for becoming a Vtuber, I hope that one day we could collab,

1668
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,560
even though the odds are probably super low.

1669
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,560
Well, good luck.

1670
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,560
It's good to have goals.

1671
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:29,560
Sweet.

1672
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:32,560
Cool, I hope it works out.

1673
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,560
For a Kuma Forever one, thank you.

1674
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,560
Oh, thank you.

1675
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,560
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

1676
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,560
Many times, thank you.

1677
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,560
Yeah, right.

1678
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,560
I don't mind talking to Bubba, because they're just like, Bubba, you're so cute.

1679
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,560
Bubba, you look so handsome today.

1680
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,560
Bubba, who's a good boy?

1681
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,560
Thank you.

1682
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,560
Thank you.

1683
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,560
It's fun to watch you go for times.

1684
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,560
Oh, and the sunlight.

1685
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,560
Thank you.

1686
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,560
Well, we'll see.

1687
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,560
We'll see this week, maybe.

1688
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:05,560
Vek, thank you.

1689
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:08,560
A red arrow one now.

1690
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,560
All right, let's show the class.

1691
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,560
Red arrow one now.

1692
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,560
Oh, this looks like a fish who could catch an animal crossing.

1693
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,560
Oh, I forgot this image was up here.

1694
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,560
Mmm, pretty.

1695
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,560
It looks like a big betta fish.

1696
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,560
Yeah, very bright colored.

1697
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,560
Cute.

1698
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,560
They're chunky.

1699
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,560
Very chunky.

1700
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,560
This is a caption on this one.

1701
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,560
It's transporting a rare arrow one.

1702
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:44,560
You can see how big it is compared to the arms.

1703
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:49,560
Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.

1704
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,560
300 or more.

1705
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,560
Hot Cheeto fish.

1706
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,560
Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.

1707
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,560
Okay, stamps.

1708
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:59,560
This is the last Super Chat.

1709
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:00,560
Don't send it anymore.

1710
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,560
If you do, just know that I'm not going to read it.

1711
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:04,560
This is the last Super Chat.

1712
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:05,560
Can I say, thanks so much.

1713
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,560
I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,

1714
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:09,560
even though they're not as long as they used to be,

1715
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:13,560
but we get a nice condensed version.

1716
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,560
And we have time for other stuff later.

1717
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,560
All right, well, you guys have six minutes.

1718
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:23,560
Let me go open up steam.

1719
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:26,560
Uh-huh.

1720
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:30,560
Four titties.

1721
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,560
Titties.

1722
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:36,560
30 bucks.

1723
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,560
I'll make it back.

1724
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:40,560
Wait, should I get Cities Skyline Deluxe Edition?

1725
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:45,560
Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.

1726
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:52,560
And Harbor means $10 more.

1727
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,560
Get the Deluxe.

1728
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,560
All right.

1729
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:01,560
Fine.

1730
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,560
All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream

1731
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:04,560
because I'm paranoid.

1732
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:12,560
Okay, it's in the cards, though.

1733
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,560
All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?

1734
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,560
Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.

1735
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,560
Oh, my God.

1736
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,560
Swimsuit wallpaper.

1737
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,560
I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,

1738
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:31,560
which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.

1739
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:36,560
But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.

1740
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,560
Oh, no, I'm a doko.

1741
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,560
Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.

1742
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,560
Yeah, that went well, right?

1743
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,560
Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.

1744
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,560
I'm going to take a break.

1745
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:55,560
I'm going to clean up an area where I made a mess.

1746
01:55:55,560 --> 01:56:00,560
And then I'm going to have a snack.

1747
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:05,560
And then I have to install Cities Skyline, so yes.

1748
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:09,560
Oh, just in time.

1749
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,560
Let me pull up the lyrics so I can learn them better.

1750
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:50,560
So fast.

1751
01:56:50,560 --> 01:57:00,560
So fast.

1752
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:10,560
So fast.

1753
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:25,560
So fast.

1754
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:33,560
So fast.

1755
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,560
So fast.

1756
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:38,560
So fast.

1757
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,560
Okay, okay.

1758
01:57:41,560 --> 01:58:10,560
So fast.

1759
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:16,560
It's hard to follow along. It's so fast.

1760
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:51,560
So fast.

1761
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:30,560
Thank you guys for watching.

1762
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:35,560
I will see you in an hour.

1763
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:42,560
My PC is so hot.

1764
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,560
Okay.

1765
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,560
Bye.

1766
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:50,560
Wait, wait, wait.

1767
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,560
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1768
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:53,560
We didn't reach the two hour mark yet.

1769
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:54,560
Hold on. Hold on.

1770
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,560
I'm still going.

1771
01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:12,560
So fast.
