48|You
49|Okay, now Bubba about his playing can you guys hear it sorry I had to hold on
50|Okay
51|Okay, yeah, it's loud okay, I'll turn down a little bit
52|Okay, turn it down is that better
53|You can hear now, okay cool. So yeah, the key is already open and it fills up really fast because you guys are like
54|robots
55|Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm
56|Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know
57|I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm
58|Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream
59|But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed
60|And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out
61|So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub
62|It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower
63|Mm-hmm
64|Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle
65|So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably
66|I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover
67|Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins
68|They're pretty good. I think I
69|Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I
70|Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead
71|Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a
72|It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you
73|Where is it, um
74|Let's see
75|Okay
76|Weird hold on let me cut there for a second
77|Oh
78|Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?
79|Disappeared
80|The office is gone
81|Doesn't make any sense
82|Don't make no sense. Wait
83|There's that
84|It's probably just like an OBS problem
85|Oh
86|What if I duplicate
87|All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh
88|Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here
89|Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office
90|I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect
91|We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh
92|And it's like it looks 3d
93|Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else
94|Are you guys doing today on this Sunday? Oh
95|That's better now it doesn't look like I'm reading although my arms look so big
96|Good
97|Does that work
98|Is it I think it's just too big in general
99|Immersion chillin at bed nice hungry get a snack
100|That's a little bit better maybe just a tiny bit
101|Wait, is this is this lined up this where is this supposed to be? Oh here looks so high
102|Okay, well what it looks scuff to me wait, okay, I just don't look don't look don't look don't look
103|What happened to Papa but is it playing cuz I don't hear anything
104|Is it just a really quiet song is there just like a minute of silence at the end of a song or something
105|It stopped it broke
106|But it only lets me play this one song. Well, then let me reload it really quick
107|Okay, hopefully that fixed it. Yeah, I guess it has to be this way. Very funny. Very funny. Yeah
108|Shoot
109|I'm trying to hide this misaligned pillow. Oh, what is this? Maybe if I
110|Look the pillow has like a little bite taken out of it. I think it's supposed to go by this armrest, but it don't fit
111|So I'm a lid I won't fit
112|Okay, we'll say that that's don't look oh my god don't look what this is confusing

115|All right, so we have all gathered here today
116|To give thanks for thy super chats
117|Uh
118|Wait, does anybody know where from where I'm reading from super chat's from my head is too big
119|Oh
120|Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you
121|Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank
122|Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about
123|Oh
124|You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs
125|I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to
126|Just to like go outside and talk
127|with person at the store
128|But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream
129|I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I
130|Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just
131|Not healthy for my tummy. Oh
132|What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule
133|Oh
134|Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up
135|For the next
136|The next coming this coming week, let's see
137|I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was
138|Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday
139|Wait, yes, it was a Monday
140|No
141|It was on Tuesday
142|Okay, okay
143|Sorry, sorry
144|Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule
145|sort of
146|Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring
147|starting at AMT time and
148|Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think
149|So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier
150|So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week
151|Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet
152|If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream
153|I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream
154|So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know
155|I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and
156|Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring
157|I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark
158|So I'm not sure
159|If it's gonna be on that day
160|But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh
161|Then on Friday
162|What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one
163|Keep having to refresh it every time
164|Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now
165|I
166|I
167|I
168|Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something
169|That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing
170|All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday
171|We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again
172|Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some
173|Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it
174|Is that like a bird an alarm
175|Alright super chats from
176|Five days ago got it. Oh
177|But before we read super chat, she's gonna see look look look wait
178|Oh
179|Look at this wait, it's too big
180|Hold on oh
181|It's gone and disappeared what the heck
182|Oh
183|It's gone oh
184|Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today
185|Look at the starfish
186|Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank
187|But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it
188|Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose
189|to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so
190|Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass
191|It's cute, right?
192|You can see the mouth in the center there
193|Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy
194|Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the
195|You know the land
196|The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to
197|Yeah, both it's both weird
198|Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small
199|so small and then also
200|Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small
201|This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought
202|It's um
203|Can I use the point?
204|It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer
205|like a little cursor to drag around the screen
206|Alright, I'll point with
207|This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone
208|I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and
209|the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and
210|Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?
211|it's
212|Okay, the video was unavailable
213|Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned
214|I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh
215|Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is
216|It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning
217|They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab
218|Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting
219|things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and
220|In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone
221|So they have like a really cute relationship
222|Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them
223|Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm
224|Now you could see it
225|It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything
226|This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too
227|Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it
228|Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color
229|Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it
230|But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm
231|So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know
232|I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing
233|So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and
234|Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm
235|But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it
236|I want to protect it
237|Yeah, this a anemone
238|It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute
239|They're so cute. And then
240|And then let me see, hold on
241|Hold on
242|Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in
243|Okay, now I will show you guys
244|The frog
245|After I change something really quick
246|Um
247|This one
248|Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm
249|You frog
250|Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up
251|All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels
252|There's one of the frogs
253|Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um
254|He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water
255|They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air
256|And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air
257|Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together
258|But let me see
259|No, this is the only picture I have actually
260|Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again
261|Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them
262|Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny
263|Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out
264|Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space
265|Yeah, we'll see
266|Look at them. I need to zoom in
267|Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them
268|But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams
269|Seems cute
270|What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets
271|They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face
272|They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning
273|And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing
274|So it was getting a mouthful of sand
275|Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it
276|No, they don't usually bother shrimp
277|Not that I've seen anyway
278|I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth
279|But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything
280|I
281|Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys
282|Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted
283|But it doesn't look like we have too much to go

306|But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good
307|I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well
308|Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates
309|They start messing around in the game
310|Yeah, it's it's well
311|It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to

367|issues with like nutrition or vitamins
368|Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name
369|Yeah, it's called a Luna lei
370|Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and
371|And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions
372|It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways
373|But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something
374|That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I
375|Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe

387|We'll see I
388|Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it
389|It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch
390|It takes less time. Well, I don't know
391|I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex
392|Maybe it's not that much time
393|But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die
394|Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though
395|Hmm
396|Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something
397|Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob
398|Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh

702|I was just like looking through Pixel
703|and I was trying so many different pictures
704|and like it's just that, you know,
705|having blonde hair and being super pale,
706|it's kind of hard with contrast,
707|like to find a good image that contrasts properly
708|for like a small profile picture.
709|So I was just Googling my name
710|and looking through the images and I found this one
711|and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images
712|I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.
713|So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.
714|So I decided to keep it.
715|Magic, magic.
716|Oh, right dude, thank you.
717|Yuste, kam samita.

724|like some pictures of some very dedicated
725|Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,
726|like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.
727|I think they were camping out like at midnight,
728|waiting for it to open
729|because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.
730|So take some dedication, you know.
731|It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout
732|for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.
733|Yeah, they're very dedicated
734|and they seem really happy too.
735|I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.
736|It'd be awesome.
737|Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,
738|but still.
739|Yeah, that's true.
740|They keep underestimating us.
741|When will they learn?
742|Psycho, thank you.

814|Like tons and tons of carrots.

835|Wajaleo, thank you.
836|Twilight, thank you.
837|Fishstar, thank you.
838|Alright, only about 20% left of the superchets, including the ones from the stream.
839|Itchy.
840|Hold on.
841|Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
842|It's a guy's simulator, I like that.
843|Uh, Rekukun, thank you.
844|Um, A screen, thank you.
845|Truckson.
846|Can I say it? So thank you.
847|Thank you for watching.
848|Kamsamita.
849|Kamsamita.
850|Jiho, komawa yo.
851|Mayscreen, thank you.
852|Aw, thank you.
853|Kuristai, thank you.
854|Alright, now superchets from two days ago. What did we do two days ago?
855|Oh, wait, is this from the free chat? Oh, no.
856|Okay, I guess there's some from the free chat and then some from the today stream.
857|Kuristai, thank you.
858|Oh, Rekukun, thank you.
859|I'm at Crunchyroll Expo for the next two days.
860|I'll be the vlogging. Oh, nice.
861|Did I stream? I don't remember.
862|Just in time, thank you.
863|I hope you enjoyed the convention.
864|Oh, karaoke.
865|Rekukun, thank you.
866|Oh, oh, yes.
867|It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,
868|but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,
869|I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,
870|close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert
871|and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short
872|because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.
873|Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?
874|Aw, cool.
875|Yeah, it was really cool.
876|I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,
877|so her voice was not that great.
878|She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,
879|so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,
880|but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,
881|it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?
882|And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.
883|It's so cool.
884|Mm-hmm, so magical.
885|Aw, where was I?
886|Aw, I made me a thank you.
887|How was it to meet some of your fans?
888|I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,
889|so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,
890|well, how was your convention going?
891|Did you see the KFP stand?
892|I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?
893|Did you see the Artist Alley?
894|How many did I meet?
895|I think, I don't know the exact number,
896|but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.
897|I think a little bit more than 20.
898|Aw, okay, good, thank you.
899|I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.
900|Good, it's a bad influence.
901|Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.
902|It was just some guy in the crowd.
903|Ms. Mint, thank you.
904|Yeah, we made a thank you.
905|Can I ask about the coin purse?
906|It's super cute and I want one.
907|I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,
908|like a long time ago.
909|Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.
910|Pickle Rick, thank you.
911|Next meeting greets, yeah.
912|I wouldn't mind doing them as often.
913|This is convention season still right now,
914|but during convention season I don't mind doing it.
915|It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.
916|I think doing the panel was more difficult
917|than doing the meeting greets because,
918|well, usually in the past when we do panels,
919|there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC
920|who deals with handling the crowd
921|and asking questions and things like that
922|and just keeping the flow going for the panel,
923|but because it was up to each of us,
924|Good and I were talking about different ideas
925|that we could do for the panel,
926|and we just didn't come to a conclusion
927|of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.
928|I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,
929|and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.
930|So we had a lot of ideas,
931|but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,
932|like, oh, just, you know, questions.
933|MeTuber support, okay.
934|It was easy.
935|And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,
936|so I really wanted to, you know,
937|work with that too and do a little musical thing.
938|Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.
939|I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.
940|If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.
941|If I could even get that effect in OBS,
942|which it kind of worked.
943|I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.
944|I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.
945|But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll
946|if we could hand out.
947|I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.
948|If we could hand out like blue and red,
949|those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,
950|something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.
951|I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.
952|You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.
953|But I think it was too last minute anyways.
954|Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.
955|I don't even know how that would be possible.
956|I know you can rent 3D glasses.
957|You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,
958|but those work differently.
959|It's like it takes...
960|Hmm.
961|I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.
962|It like polarizes light circularly.
963|And so what it is, is like when you're watching
964|one of those 3D movies in theaters,
965|is they have like two projectors going,
966|or one that switches really fast back and forth,
967|and they're polarized.
968|Circularly polarized in opposite directions,
969|and each lens only allows one directional,
970|one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.
971|I think I get it.
972|Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.
973|Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.
974|Unless we had a special projector.
975|It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.
976|How do they work?
977|Um...
978|Okay, yeah, light wave physics.
979|It was interesting watching.
980|I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,
981|but this is like pretty complicated.
982|They like talking about, you know, the light waves
983|and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.
984|And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.
985|I don't even think I took a physics class.
986|Oh, no.
987|I kind of took a physics class, yeah.
988|Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.
989|Two YouTube tutorials later.
990|How do magnets work?
991|I don't know, how do they work?
992|It's magic.
993|Um...
994|Let's see.
995|Where was I?
996|Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.
997|Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,
998|I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,
999|I guess it sort of implied there might be something else
1000|coming up soon, so I don't know.
1001|I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,
1002|it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,
1003|but I'm not sure yet.
1004|Uh, no confirmations yet.
1005|Uh, Vercatos, thank you.
1006|Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.
1007|My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember
1008|some of the anime that I really liked.
1009|So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked
1010|and that I remembered that I liked,
1011|but I think there's some anime that I really liked too
1012|that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.
1013|Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?
1014|Congratulations!
1015|A marriage, whoa!
1016|Nice, thank you for the support.
1017|I hope they have a successful marriage.
1018|Marriage.
1019|SS109, thank you.
1020|Picoric, thank you.
1021|Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?
1022|Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.
1023|It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.
1024|Um...
1025|Amidoko kamsamita!
1026|Ah, come on way up.
1027|Fates, thank you.
1028|Yo, yo, yo.
1029|I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.
1030|Amazing sand, thank you.
1031|Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing
1032|for next year's Crunchyroll convention,
1033|but it did seem like a lot of fun,
1034|especially I just tweeted something before the stream.
1035|Everybody's like, ame, ame.
1036|And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.
1037|A small ame was there dancing.
1038|Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.
1039|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1040|It doesn't have to be, you know,
1041|only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.
1042|Um...
1043|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1044|Super Sunday time.
1045|Stratus fight, thank you.
1046|Immediates, thank you.
1047|Bus, thank you.
1048|You can get a degree at the panel the other day.
1049|Thanks so well.
1050|How different was it singing
1051|and being able to watch the crowd?
1052|Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...
1053|Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,
1054|I wasn't watching the crowd
1055|because I was looking at the lyrics.
1056|But, um, yeah, like I said,
1057|watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.
1058|Mm-hmm.
1059|And Smart Boy, thank you.
1060|Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.
1061|Puru put it in at this point.
1062|But you just don't know.
1063|I just wanted to make sure I got it right.
1064|Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.
1065|That'd be cool.
1066|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1067|Tried making amine last night.
1068|It tasted pretty good.
1069|Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.
1070|I'm glad you liked it.
1071|Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.
1072|Aww.
1073|Oh, thank you.
1074|Thank you for the question.
1075|I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.
1076|I-R-L.
1077|Mm-hmm.
1078|Yeah, I'm done.
1079|Mm-hmm.
1080|Yesterday, I got something to do.
1081|This song sounds...
1082|This song sounds kind of sad.
1083|But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.
1084|Alpha 9 5 7 1.
1085|Ooh.
1086|Cool.
1087|Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.
1088|Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.
1089|Thank you.
1090|Thank you.
1091|Thank you.
1092|Aww, thank you.
1093|I'm glad you enjoyed.
1094|Wait.
1095|Thank you.
1096|I'll see you laughing.
1097|Thank you.
1098|Ask Pei.
1099|Thank you.
1100|Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?
1101|Maybe, perhaps?
1102|Uh, I think it's an affiliate.
1103|I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.
1104|Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.
1105|So, I'll, uh, get started on that.
1106|Mm-hmm.
1107|Ifmefa, thank you.
1108|Oh.
1109|Aww, thank you.
1110|Aww, thank you.
1111|Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.
1112|Esta ludos desde Chile.
1113|Oh, Chile.
1114|Very chill.
1115|Muchas gracias.
1116|Anti-whippy, thank you.
1117|It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.
1118|She even became Ian's old mascot.
1119|You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?
1120|Oh.
1121|Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.
1122|I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.
1123|So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.
1124|You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.
1125|So, yeah.
1126|But, yeah, it is really crazy.
1127|It is surprising.
1128|But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,
1129|and people started using them in memes.
1130|So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.
1131|She's, like, 40 now.
1132|Small Aime is the real idol here.
1133|Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.
1134|What do you guys think?
1135|Oh, there's an idea.
1136|Hey, I can do it on my own.
1137|Well, not all alone, but...
1138|Huh.
1139|All right, well, stay tuned.
1140|Flynn Playmable, thank you.
1141|Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.
1142|TK, thank you.
1143|First, Akka Super Chat.
1144|Oh, that was a solid one.
1145|Thank you so much, TK.
1146|Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.
1147|Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.
1148|Thank you.
1149|At TotoCubes, thank you.
1150|Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?
1151|Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.
1152|Me too.
1153|Last time, 39. Thank you.
1154|The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.
1155|It looks so good.
1156|Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.
1157|Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?
1158|Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...
1159|Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.
1160|Right next, thank you.
1161|Does Mama get put back in the box?
1162|Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.
1163|I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?
1164|At TK, thank you.
1165|Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.
1166|Aw.
1167|Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.
1168|I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.
1169|Thank you, thank you for the support.
1170|Thank you.
1171|Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.
1172|I'm in it all night.
1173|Rock the gas bar. Rock the...
1174|Lock the taskbar.
1175|All right, dear. Thank you.
1176|Yeah.
1177|It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...
1178|You know, I think she's getting better.
1179|I think she's improving a little bit.
1180|Uh, Lynn, thank you.
1181|YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.
1182|There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,
1183|and even has a shark egg.
1184|Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,
1185|fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.
1186|Watch me put them in.
1187|And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,
1188|what's up, fish heads?
1189|And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.
1190|And it's not even that cool when you see it.
1191|I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...
1192|They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,
1193|really high-quality videos of their tanks.
1194|And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,
1195|and there's, like, relaxing music, so...
1196|That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.
1197|Uh, Kram, thank you so much!
1198|Another big substitute!
1199|It just says,
1200|I'm in!
1201|Thank you so much for the support.
1202|TK, the third big super check!
1203|Thank you so much!
1204|Huh?
1205|Aww, thank you, TK.
1206|So sweet!
1207|I see another one here, but TK, again.
1208|Here, look, he's always so fun.
1209|Game streams, always entertaining.
1210|Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,
1211|but his stream is so comfy,
1212|and video stream projects always spark excitement.
1213|Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!
1214|Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1215|So sweet!
1216|Thank you so much!
1217|I really appreciate it.
1218|I'm glad, uh, you know,
1219|at the end of the day,
1220|if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,
1221|I'm happy, so thank you.
1222|And Majin D, thank you!
1223|Majin 8, thank you!
1224|I'll see you in the bar!
1225|Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,
1226|I hope you get there safe.
1227|I hope you win the lottery one day for the...
1228|not just the regular lottery,
1229|the main green lottery, I guess.
1230|Uh, right here!
1231|Thank you!
1232|Endless Ame!
1233|Only around Halloween.
1234|Rock the guest box!
1235|Ame, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee!
1236|Uh, Roger Liao, thank you!
1237|Ame, ame, ame, ame, ame!
1238|A12 Flames.
1239|Thank you!
1240|Oh!
1241|Oh, the deep skies nuts!
1242|Yeah, that was a tweet that I read during the panel.
1243|Thank you for the question!
1244|Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1245|Oh my god, this song is really loud.
1246|Okay.
1247|Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.
1248|Uh, where was I?
1249|Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1250|Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.
1251|Uh-huh.
1252|Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!
1253|Oh!
1254|Uh, thank you so much!
1255|Thank you!
1256|I hope you also have a yummy food!
1257|Mm-hmm!
1258|Thank you so much for all the support.
1259|I appreciate it.
1260|Nagi!
1261|Oh, thank you!
1262|Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!
1263|Oh, it was really sweet!
1264|Thank you so much!
1265|Nagi's so cute!
1266|So cute!
1267|Yeah, we got some pictures together.
1268|Thank you, thank you for all your support.
1269|I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.
1270|Thank you!
1271|So many cute teammates!
1272|Thank you!
1273|Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.
1274|Did I have any input for the figure?
1275|Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,
1276|but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.
1277|I think it was for that one.
1278|Mm-hmm.
1279|Aaron Pampo, thank you!
1280|Happy birthday!
1281|This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.
1282|Ooh, an amé party!
1283|Dang, amé cake!
1284|Amé day!
1285|No, just kidding.
1286|I hope the cake was tasty.
1287|I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.
1288|Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!
1289|I hope you have a good rest of the day.
1290|Night!
1291|Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?
1292|Amé cake?
1293|Mm-hmm, amé party!
1294|Very cool.
1295|A flag armor, thank you!
1296|I'll be out of blackberries!
1297|No, no, they're still on the...
1298|They left them on the counter, they're still there!
1299|Eduardo, thank you!
1300|Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.
1301|Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?
1302|Did I say that?
1303|Oh...
1304|I don't remember.
1305|Uh...
1306|Yes, just assume that...
1307|Yes, uh-huh.
1308|I could be at 9-9, thank you!
1309|Um, many times, thank you!
1310|Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,
1311|because, you know, the people around you,
1312|if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,
1313|but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,
1314|at least have heard of it.
1315|Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,
1316|so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.
1317|Mm-hmm!
1318|Xinyoung-ho!
1319|Thank you!
1320|Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!
1321|Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,
1322|aim for 22 games in 2022?
1323|How many do I need left?
1324|How many left are there that I need to complete?
1325|I think it's possible, what?
1326|How many months?
1327|We still have 5 months.
1328|I think it's possible.
1329|20 more to go! 19?
1330|Well, I have some shorter games.
1331|Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,
1332|that I think we could do.
1333|But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,
1334|and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,
1335|Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.
1336|I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.
1337|And I know, um,
1338|there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,
1339|but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,
1340|and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,
1341|and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,
1342|like a platform or something, like a 2D.
1343|Ooh, I did want to play, um...
1344|Hey!
1345|What was that one game?
1346|I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.
1347|Uh...
1348|Crash Bandicoot!
1349|Yeah, I'm gonna play.
1350|Stray? I don't know, it looks...
1351|It looks cute, but I don't know.
1352|Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
1353|Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...
1354|Switch?
1355|Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,
1356|I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,
1357|it seems like a game that would take me a while.
1358|Uh...
1359|It is?
1360|Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?
1361|We'll see.
1362|Uh, Multi, thank you.
1363|Aww...
1364|Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.
1365|Mm-hmm.
1366|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1367|Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity
1368|to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.
1369|Mm-hmm.
1370|Anyways, thank you.
1371|Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.
1372|I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.
1373|Have a snack.
1374|Maybe I'll make a sandwich.
1375|Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.
1376|Um, what do you mean, what?
1377|Huh?
1378|Go to start, thank you.
1379|Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.
1380|Agent Quirobo, thank you.
1381|Gracias.
1382|Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.
1383|Would there be a post for the schedule this week?
1384|Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.
1385|I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.
1386|Mm-hmm.
1387|I think I will post something.
1388|I don't know yet.
1389|If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,
1390|like 24 hours before.
1391|Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.
1392|Mm-hmm.
1393|Semen 2016, oh, thank you.
1394|I hope you're having a good day too.
1395|Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed
1396|the Eurotruck sim stream.
1397|You mean?
1398|Yasami-ka!
1399|Thank you.
1400|Antipi, thank you.
1401|Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays
1402|might be a good way to help fill out the week.
1403|Possibly.
1404|That is true.
1405|Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.
1406|I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.
1407|I keep forgetting.
1408|Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.
1409|It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams
1410|that I've done on there, and I will upload them there
1411|for archive reasons.
1412|Archival, is that a word?
1413|Uh...
1414|Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?
1415|No, Bart, thank you.
1416|Where's Super Chat?
1417|Sorry, we do pops here.
1418|I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it
1419|like a, say something bad or something.
1420|Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.
1421|Twitch sucks!
1422|Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective
1423|good to stream every now and then.
1424|Okay, like imagine this.
1425|Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,
1426|and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.
1427|Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.
1428|Now, of course there's discoverability,
1429|you know, possible within YouTube,
1430|and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,
1431|our whole audience is on YouTube.
1432|But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,
1433|a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,
1434|okay, you could have one person
1435|streaming their perspective on Twitch,
1436|and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.
1437|That's business, baby!
1438|But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming
1439|like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,
1440|it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,
1441|I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.
1442|I don't know.
1443|Maybe it's just all in my head.
1444|I gotta check the statistics.
1445|Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.
1446|How about that?
1447|What was the other one?
1448|Video motion.
1449|Thank you.
1450|Thank you.
1451|Oh, gracias.
1452|The motherfucking workers, thank you.
1453|Nanji Misa, arigato.
1454|Ame-chan, kawaii.
1455|Thank you.
1456|Arigato.
1457|Shadowfire, thank you.
1458|Oh, muchas gracias.
1459|Nice.
1460|Ellen Saputro.
1461|Thank you.
1462|Oh, Arowanas.
1463|Yeah, they look cool.
1464|I like them when they're small, when they're babies,
1465|but Arowana is a type of fish.
1466|They get big.
1467|They get really big, and they'll bite you,
1468|and you can bleed and stuff.
1469|It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank
1470|for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.
1471|Boi-boo, boi-boo.
1472|They're so cute when they're small,
1473|because their eyes are really big.
1474|Let me see if I can show a picture.
1475|Whoa, what is this?
1476|They have this sack.
1477|A weird sack.
1478|What is this weird sack that they have?
1479|I'll show you this picture.
1480|Oh, see, they're so cute.
1481|Yeah, they're expensive.
1482|See, they have this little weird sack.
1483|Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?
1484|Because it looks like only the babies have them.
1485|What is that?
1486|They're born with it?
1487|A digestion sack?
1488|Yeah, they get really big, though.
1489|Let's see, fully grown.
1490|Here.
1491|Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.
1492|This is good for perspective.
1493|I don't know who that is,
1494|but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.
1495|Wait, this looks like Photoshop.
1496|No, it's not real.
1497|It's a clickbait image.
1498|They're not that big.
1499|Let's see if I can find a better picture.
1500|Okay, this is a good one.
1501|Bim, bam, bim, bam.
1502|Oh, my God.
1503|Okay.
1504|Okay.
1505|Yeah.
1506|Yeah, they're cute.
1507|Cute, cute.
1508|Omega hot dog.
1509|Thank you.
1510|What do you call an omega that makes gluten-filled bread?
1511|A Watsonburg dishes baking bed.
1512|Ha, ha.
1513|Very funny.
1514|Oh, Julia, thank you.
1515|What?
1516|Halfway.
1517|Thank you.
1518|You done?
1519|Thank you.
1520|I saw a small omelet at this event.
1521|I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.
1522|Yago was also there.
1523|Didn't do anything to him, right?
1524|Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?
1525|Or since earlier today?
1526|Suss.
1527|Suss.
1528|Maka, thank you.
1529|This is a big super chat.
1530|If you don't remember backstaters,
1531|don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.
1532|Let me see.
1533|Grindings like neon white.
1534|Hmm?
1535|Yeah, we'll see.
1536|I just feel like for people watching,
1537|maybe it's like repetitive or something.
1538|I do think it is pretty fun, though.
1539|I don't really mind backstating neon white
1540|because I don't even look at chat
1541|unless I ask you guys a question.
1542|I'm sorry, boy.
1543|Thank you.
1544|Ryan, Quebec.
1545|Thank you.
1546|That's right.
1547|Investigators.
1548|No bathroom breaks.
1549|Investigator breaks only.
1550|Investigator meetings only.
1551|A look-in.
1552|Thank you.
1553|Huh?
1554|Okay.
1555|Face of motion.
1556|Thank you.
1557|Yeah.
1558|Bubble bot.
1559|MVP.
1560|Oh, what's it, Mila 5?
1561|Oh, 1527.
1562|Oh, thank you.
1563|Yes, I'll pick them up.
1564|Thank you.
1565|Lucky senpai.
1566|Thank you.
1567|Oh, at the meet and greet.
1568|Thank you for stopping by.
1569|Thank you for the super chat.
1570|I appreciate it.
1571|Thank you.
1572|Itsu-mo.
1573|Kamalaya.
1574|Is it itsu-mo?
1575|Is it like it always...
1576|It means like it's always or something?
1577|Always.
1578|AirW1, thank you.
1579|Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?
1580|Three fish got battered.
1581|Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?
1582|Oh, I like that one.
1583|That's a good one.
1584|Okay, P-back.
1585|I see.
1586|I see.
1587|Okay.
1588|Hi, Gavin Dorff.
1589|Thank you.
1590|I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.
1591|What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?
1592|I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.
1593|Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.
1594|Something like that?
1595|Oh, what are they called?
1596|Dragon?
1597|Dragon days?
1598|No.
1599|Sea dragons.
1600|Yeah, sea dragons.
1601|And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.
1602|Pipefish, I think?
1603|They're so cute.
1604|Oh, garden eels.
1605|Yeah, I like seeing those types.
1606|Seahorses especially.
1607|You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater
1608|person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses
1609|had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses
1610|in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they
1611|give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue
1612|inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the
1613|tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.
1614|It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.
1615|So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the
1616|seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like
1617|where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels
1618|so that the seahorse can swim normally again.
1619|So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary
1620|to do.
1621|And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.
1622|Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.
1623|Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they
1624|like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like
1625|a build up of gas.
1626|Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.
1627|Mm-hmm.
1628|It's scary.
1629|What does that happen to us?
1630|Maybe it does.
1631|All right.
1632|Hello, thank you.
1633|Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.
1634|Yeah, thank you.
1635|Happy early international cat day to Wellington Henry.
1636|Oh cute, what is that?
1637|International cat day tomorrow?

1647|Oh my gosh.
1648|Oh my gosh.
1649|Oh my gosh.
1650|What is that, international cat day tomorrow, there's too many of these like weird holidays,
1651|internet holidays.

1653|Epic work, thank you.
1654|Smalmed, we'll take over the world.
1655|That'll one, thank you.
1656|Can I hire Smalmed to come to my birthday party?
1657|That'd be funny.
1658|I'll keep them as a backup plan, yes.
1659|I'll tell Smalmed that could be a good backup plan.
1660|A Vtuber fan, thank you.
1661|Oh, shout out to, I don't know about that, but I really appreciate all the support to
1662|a Vtuber fan, thank you.
1663|Thank you.
1664|Thank you.
1665|Thank you.
1666|Thank you.
1667|You're my main inspiration for becoming a Vtuber, I hope that one day we could collab,
1668|even though the odds are probably super low.
1669|Well, good luck.
1670|It's good to have goals.
1671|Sweet.
1672|Cool, I hope it works out.
1673|For a Kuma Forever one, thank you.
1674|Oh, thank you.
1675|Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
1676|Many times, thank you.
1677|Yeah, right.
1678|I don't mind talking to Bubba, because they're just like, Bubba, you're so cute.
1679|Bubba, you look so handsome today.
1680|Bubba, who's a good boy?
1681|Thank you.
1682|Thank you.
1683|It's fun to watch you go for times.
1684|Oh, and the sunlight.
1685|Thank you.
1686|Well, we'll see.
1687|We'll see this week, maybe.
1688|Vek, thank you.
1689|A red arrow one now.
1690|All right, let's show the class.
1691|Red arrow one now.
1692|Oh, this looks like a fish who could catch an animal crossing.
1693|Oh, I forgot this image was up here.
1694|Mmm, pretty.
1695|It looks like a big betta fish.
1696|Yeah, very bright colored.
1697|Cute.
1698|They're chunky.
1699|Very chunky.
1700|This is a caption on this one.
1701|It's transporting a rare arrow one.
1702|You can see how big it is compared to the arms.
1703|Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.
1704|300 or more.
1705|Hot Cheeto fish.
1706|Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.
1707|Okay, stamps.
1708|This is the last Super Chat.
1709|Don't send it anymore.
1710|If you do, just know that I'm not going to read it.
1711|This is the last Super Chat.
1712|Can I say, thanks so much.
1713|I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,
1714|even though they're not as long as they used to be,
1715|but we get a nice condensed version.
1716|And we have time for other stuff later.
1717|All right, well, you guys have six minutes.
1718|Let me go open up steam.
1719|Uh-huh.
1720|Four titties.
1721|Titties.
1722|30 bucks.
1723|I'll make it back.
1724|Wait, should I get Cities Skyline Deluxe Edition?
1725|Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.
1726|And Harbor means $10 more.
1727|Get the Deluxe.
1728|All right.
1729|Fine.
1730|All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream
1731|because I'm paranoid.
1732|Okay, it's in the cards, though.
1733|All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?
1734|Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.
1735|Oh, my God.
1736|Swimsuit wallpaper.
1737|I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,
1738|which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.
1739|But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.
1740|Oh, no, I'm a doko.
1741|Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.
1742|Yeah, that went well, right?
1743|Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.
1744|I'm going to take a break.
1745|I'm going to clean up an area where I made a mess.
1746|And then I'm going to have a snack.
1747|And then I have to install Cities Skyline, so yes.
1748|Oh, just in time.

54|robots
55|Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm
56|Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know
57|I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm
58|Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream
59|But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed
60|And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out
61|So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub
62|It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower
63|Mm-hmm
64|Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle
65|So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably
66|I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover
67|Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins
68|They're pretty good. I think I
69|Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I
70|Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead
71|Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a
72|It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you
73|Where is it, um
74|Let's see
75|Okay
76|Weird hold on let me cut there for a second
77|Oh
78|Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?
79|Disappeared
80|The office is gone
81|Doesn't make any sense
82|Don't make no sense. Wait
83|There's that
84|It's probably just like an OBS problem
85|Oh
86|What if I duplicate
87|All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh
88|Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here
89|Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office
90|I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect
91|We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh
92|And it's like it looks 3d
93|Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else

103|What happened to Papa but is it playing cuz I don't hear anything
104|Is it just a really quiet song is there just like a minute of silence at the end of a song or something
105|It stopped it broke
106|But it only lets me play this one song. Well, then let me reload it really quick
107|Okay, hopefully that fixed it. Yeah, I guess it has to be this way. Very funny. Very funny. Yeah
108|Shoot
109|I'm trying to hide this misaligned pillow. Oh, what is this? Maybe if I
110|Look the pillow has like a little bite taken out of it. I think it's supposed to go by this armrest, but it don't fit

115|All right, so we have all gathered here today
116|To give thanks for thy super chats
117|Uh
118|Wait, does anybody know where from where I'm reading from super chat's from my head is too big
119|Oh
120|Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you
121|Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank
122|Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about
123|Oh
124|You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs
125|I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to
126|Just to like go outside and talk
127|with person at the store
128|But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream
129|I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I
130|Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just
131|Not healthy for my tummy. Oh
132|What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule
133|Oh
134|Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up
135|For the next
136|The next coming this coming week, let's see
137|I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was
138|Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday
139|Wait, yes, it was a Monday
140|No
141|It was on Tuesday
142|Okay, okay
143|Sorry, sorry
144|Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule
145|sort of
146|Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring
147|starting at AMT time and
148|Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think
149|So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier
150|So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week
151|Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet
152|If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream
153|I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream
154|So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know
155|I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and
156|Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring
157|I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark
158|So I'm not sure
159|If it's gonna be on that day
160|But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh
161|Then on Friday
162|What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one
163|Keep having to refresh it every time
164|Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now
165|I
166|I
167|I
168|Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something
169|That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing
170|All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday
171|We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again
172|Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some
173|Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it
174|Is that like a bird an alarm
175|Alright super chats from
176|Five days ago got it. Oh
177|But before we read super chat, she's gonna see look look look wait
178|Oh
179|Look at this wait, it's too big
180|Hold on oh
181|It's gone and disappeared what the heck
182|Oh
183|It's gone oh
184|Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today
185|Look at the starfish
186|Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank
187|But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it
188|Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose
189|to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so
190|Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass
191|It's cute, right?
192|You can see the mouth in the center there
193|Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy
194|Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the
195|You know the land
196|The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to
197|Yeah, both it's both weird
198|Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small
199|so small and then also
200|Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small
201|This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought
202|It's um
203|Can I use the point?
204|It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer
205|like a little cursor to drag around the screen
206|Alright, I'll point with
207|This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone
208|I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and
209|the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and
210|Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?
211|it's
212|Okay, the video was unavailable
213|Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned
214|I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh
215|Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is
216|It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning
217|They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab
218|Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting
219|things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and
220|In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone
221|So they have like a really cute relationship
222|Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them
223|Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm
224|Now you could see it
225|It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything
226|This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too
227|Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it
228|Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color
229|Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it
230|But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm
231|So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know
232|I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing
233|So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and
234|Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm
235|But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it
236|I want to protect it
237|Yeah, this a anemone
238|It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute
239|They're so cute. And then
240|And then let me see, hold on
241|Hold on
242|Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in
243|Okay, now I will show you guys
244|The frog
245|After I change something really quick
246|Um
247|This one
248|Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm
249|You frog
250|Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up
251|All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels
252|There's one of the frogs
253|Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um
254|He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water
255|They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air
256|And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air
257|Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together
258|But let me see
259|No, this is the only picture I have actually
260|Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again
261|Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them
262|Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny
263|Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out
264|Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space
265|Yeah, we'll see
266|Look at them. I need to zoom in
267|Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them
268|But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams
269|Seems cute
270|What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets
271|They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face
272|They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning
273|And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing
274|So it was getting a mouthful of sand
275|Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it
276|No, they don't usually bother shrimp
277|Not that I've seen anyway
278|I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth
279|But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything
280|I
281|Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys
282|Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted
283|But it doesn't look like we have too much to go
284|I didn't have to scroll too much to get down to these super chats now reading from the apex collab with a mume

305|I'm not that good at FPS games. I think I have my moments in like FPS games
306|But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good
307|I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well
308|Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates
309|They start messing around in the game
310|Yeah, it's it's well
311|It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to

319|Let me see if everything's still there it is it is oh my god if I were playing it now I would get
320|hold on it's spinning if

338|Bonsie, thank you
339|Well, the thing is yes as you should turn you should turn back on the screen when playing apex as you're about to land
340|So then nobody can follow you but it's difficult because if I'm the jump master
341|I have to be tapped into the game to
342|Well, I could put it on a hotkey
343|Yeah, I could put it on a hockey like uh, I
344|Guess it would be like this. Hold on. Let me see I can show you guys a demonstration if you will
345|Like that it would be just like that. Yeah, I'll put it on a hockey. That's a good idea. Thanks. I'm it
346|Okay, 360 monkey. Thank you

352|I don't really have cravings for chips
353|Yeah
354|It's a lessons. Thank you
355|And new a sign I got dog
356|Can you stay I was a thank you. I shoot a sucky. Thank you gentlemen
357|Thank you. Oh, yeah, I learned something today
358|Well, it was like while I was reading
359|researching some stuff
360|Apparently if you guys look at your nails right now
361|Do you guys have like a little white half moon at the bottom part of your nail where it like connects to your finger?
362|Do you guys have that check check?
363|everybody check
364|Yes, yes, yep, nope. No. Yes. Yes
365|Yeah, it's called the wait. I forget what it's called Luna lei. I think Luna lei
366|Uh-huh. Yeah, it means yet. It means if you're missing it, it might mean that you have
367|issues with like nutrition or vitamins
368|Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name
369|Yeah, it's called a Luna lei
370|Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and
371|And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions
372|It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways
373|But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something
374|That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I
375|Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe
376|Oh
377|That's good, maybe my I guess my feet are healthier
378|Yeah, yeah looking at look up it's like when you can tell what color it's like the color of stuff that comes out of your
379|Body indicates, you know like things in your body, right?
380|Yeah, I'm all nervous from lack of I'm a
381|Okay, okay. Oh, yeah, I like this song nice. Okay. Oh, where was I reading super chats back to super chats?
382|Pick a right thing here. Oh, that would be cool. I need toe. Thank you. It is named on sites with fuse old for six times
383|zoom, oh
384|I want to play more fuse
385|Is the season starting again soon on apex? Maybe I'll give it the good old try
386|I'll try hard
387|We'll see I
388|Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it
389|It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch
390|It takes less time. Well, I don't know
391|I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex
392|Maybe it's not that much time
393|But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die
394|Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though
395|Hmm
396|Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something
397|Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob
398|Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh
399|Okay
400|Sorry, I have this like leftover
401|Skin bubble from a blister. I just felt that you
402|You
403|Okay

653|And then also Fauna's sweater.
654|And, oh, that was cool.
655|I get it for free.
656|I don't order Mumei's birthday merch.
657|I think I'm, I think I'm done ordering people's merch,
658|because I always forget.
659|It always, well, I get like a ton of emails
660|from before the haul.
661|Does that still happen with the Hololive shop
662|where if you order merch, like it gives you an email
663|and it's like, it's at a warehouse.
664|Please pay, blah, blah, blah, blah.
665|And I'm just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
666|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
667|Yeah, Fauna's sweater is so cute.

684|to make the music start to play.
685|Then I dance from down the street and I'm, I can't read.
686|Hey, hey, hey, magic ways.
687|Ooh, you love the girl with magic ways.
688|And it's true.
689|Oh, I can't read, it's too small.

699|Must be my new YouTube, I want to say Yo YouTube.
700|My new YouTube profile picture, thank you.
701|I think that it was the, well,
702|I was just like looking through Pixel
703|and I was trying so many different pictures
704|and like it's just that, you know,
705|having blonde hair and being super pale,
706|it's kind of hard with contrast,
707|like to find a good image that contrasts properly
708|for like a small profile picture.
709|So I was just Googling my name
710|and looking through the images and I found this one
711|and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images
712|I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.
713|So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.
714|So I decided to keep it.
715|Magic, magic.
716|Oh, right dude, thank you.
717|Yuste, kam samita.
718|I ate Amaz menu at a collaboration cafe yesterday.
719|It was really good.
720|Hope there'll be more events like this next time.
721|Oh, thank you, kam samita, kam amo yo.
722|Yeah, about the cafe in Korea.
723|And yeah, I saw like what Kyara shared,
724|like some pictures of some very dedicated
725|Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,
726|like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.
727|I think they were camping out like at midnight,
728|waiting for it to open
729|because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.
730|So take some dedication, you know.
731|It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout
732|for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.
733|Yeah, they're very dedicated
734|and they seem really happy too.
735|I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.
736|It'd be awesome.
737|Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,
738|but still.
739|Yeah, that's true.
740|They keep underestimating us.
741|When will they learn?
742|Psycho, thank you.
743|Oh, some coins, thank you.
744|Pick a ring, thank you.
745|Oh yeah, I saw.
746|Was there like for real GTA six announcement?
747|Or was it like a leak or something?
748|I'm ending things, I know.
749|Oh, it's real.
750|They're working on it.
751|Didn't it take like 10 years for GTA five
752|or some like really long amount?
753|Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
754|Cool, I definitely played GTA six
755|when it comes out in four years.
756|Storm blade, thank you.

758|Faithful day.
759|Storm, oh wait, right next, thank you.
760|YouTube crashed again, thank you.

780|Shut up.
781|Aw, cute.
782|A new song, arigato.
783|Yejun, thank you.
784|Last time someone drew a picture of Smulama standing outside the big truck
785|fighting a piece of wheat straw,
786|does Smulama want to find someone's mother again?
787|Smulama's got a whole phone book,
788|whole of, uh, you know,
789|you know, uh, victims, nah, nah, nah.
790|Friends.
791|Smulama's got a lot of friends.

794|Halfwayang, thank you.
795|Yeah, GTA 5, the Europe map DLC.
796|Can I say I'm saying cute?
797|Taro Cube, saying cute.
798|Maybe trucker Smulama's license from the wrong timeline.
799|Yeah, I think so.
800|Yeah, it's not very valid here.
801|Airbumble, thank you.
802|Pickle Rick times two, thank you.
803|Boss music in Eurotrucks.
804|I guess there was as we were parking.
805|We have a day, thank you.
806|I'm glad you enjoyed the stream, thank you.
807|Thank you.
808|Thank you.
809|Yeah, everybody left the factory,
810|the carrot factory as Smulama was trying to deliver.
811|I guess it would be the, I don't know, processing plant maybe.
812|Uh-huh.
813|Damn, you could fit a lot of carrots in like a 22-foot long truck, huh?
814|Like tons and tons of carrots.
815|Whoa.
816|Okay, thank you.
817|This is harder than me landing on a sun station or parking a truck.
818|The sun station took way longer.
819|Mila, what's up, Detective Extraordinaire, thank you.
820|Hey, Solasos, thank you.
821|Wouldn't it be cool if truck sim had a Fallout mod?
822|It sounds very specific.
823|I guess it'd be more believable if Fallout had a truck sim mod.
824|Uh, Amadeus, thank you.
825|Hidezuki, thank you.
826|By color, thank you.
827|Up a creek, thank you.

839|Itchy.
840|Hold on.
841|Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
842|It's a guy's simulator, I like that.
843|Uh, Rekukun, thank you.
844|Um, A screen, thank you.
845|Truckson.

851|Mayscreen, thank you.
852|Aw, thank you.
853|Kuristai, thank you.
854|Alright, now superchets from two days ago. What did we do two days ago?
855|Oh, wait, is this from the free chat? Oh, no.
856|Okay, I guess there's some from the free chat and then some from the today stream.
857|Kuristai, thank you.
858|Oh, Rekukun, thank you.
859|I'm at Crunchyroll Expo for the next two days.
860|I'll be the vlogging. Oh, nice.
861|Did I stream? I don't remember.
862|Just in time, thank you.
863|I hope you enjoyed the convention.
864|Oh, karaoke.
865|Rekukun, thank you.
866|Oh, oh, yes.
867|It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,
868|but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,
869|I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,
870|close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert
871|and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short
872|because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.
873|Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?
874|Aw, cool.
875|Yeah, it was really cool.
876|I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,
877|so her voice was not that great.
878|She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,
879|so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,
880|but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,
881|it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?
882|And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.
883|It's so cool.
884|Mm-hmm, so magical.
885|Aw, where was I?
886|Aw, I made me a thank you.
887|How was it to meet some of your fans?
888|I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,
889|so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,
890|well, how was your convention going?
891|Did you see the KFP stand?
892|I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?
893|Did you see the Artist Alley?
894|How many did I meet?
895|I think, I don't know the exact number,
896|but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.
897|I think a little bit more than 20.
898|Aw, okay, good, thank you.
899|I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.
900|Good, it's a bad influence.
901|Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.
902|It was just some guy in the crowd.
903|Ms. Mint, thank you.
904|Yeah, we made a thank you.
905|Can I ask about the coin purse?
906|It's super cute and I want one.
907|I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,
908|like a long time ago.
909|Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.
910|Pickle Rick, thank you.
911|Next meeting greets, yeah.
912|I wouldn't mind doing them as often.
913|This is convention season still right now,
914|but during convention season I don't mind doing it.
915|It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.
916|I think doing the panel was more difficult
917|than doing the meeting greets because,
918|well, usually in the past when we do panels,
919|there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC
920|who deals with handling the crowd
921|and asking questions and things like that
922|and just keeping the flow going for the panel,
923|but because it was up to each of us,
924|Good and I were talking about different ideas
925|that we could do for the panel,
926|and we just didn't come to a conclusion
927|of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.
928|I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,
929|and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.
930|So we had a lot of ideas,
931|but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,
932|like, oh, just, you know, questions.
933|MeTuber support, okay.
934|It was easy.
935|And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,
936|so I really wanted to, you know,
937|work with that too and do a little musical thing.
938|Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.
939|I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.
940|If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.
941|If I could even get that effect in OBS,
942|which it kind of worked.
943|I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.
944|I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.
945|But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll
946|if we could hand out.
947|I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.
948|If we could hand out like blue and red,
949|those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,
950|something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.
951|I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.
952|You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.
953|But I think it was too last minute anyways.
954|Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.
955|I don't even know how that would be possible.
956|I know you can rent 3D glasses.
957|You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,
958|but those work differently.
959|It's like it takes...
960|Hmm.
961|I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.
962|It like polarizes light circularly.
963|And so what it is, is like when you're watching
964|one of those 3D movies in theaters,
965|is they have like two projectors going,
966|or one that switches really fast back and forth,
967|and they're polarized.
968|Circularly polarized in opposite directions,
969|and each lens only allows one directional,
970|one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.
971|I think I get it.
972|Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.
973|Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.
974|Unless we had a special projector.
975|It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.
976|How do they work?
977|Um...
978|Okay, yeah, light wave physics.
979|It was interesting watching.
980|I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,
981|but this is like pretty complicated.
982|They like talking about, you know, the light waves
983|and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.
984|And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.
985|I don't even think I took a physics class.
986|Oh, no.
987|I kind of took a physics class, yeah.
988|Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.
989|Two YouTube tutorials later.
990|How do magnets work?
991|I don't know, how do they work?
992|It's magic.
993|Um...
994|Let's see.
995|Where was I?
996|Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.
997|Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,
998|I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,
999|I guess it sort of implied there might be something else
1000|coming up soon, so I don't know.
1001|I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,
1002|it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,
1003|but I'm not sure yet.
1004|Uh, no confirmations yet.
1005|Uh, Vercatos, thank you.
1006|Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.
1007|My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember
1008|some of the anime that I really liked.
1009|So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked
1010|and that I remembered that I liked,
1011|but I think there's some anime that I really liked too
1012|that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.
1013|Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?
1014|Congratulations!
1015|A marriage, whoa!
1016|Nice, thank you for the support.
1017|I hope they have a successful marriage.
1018|Marriage.
1019|SS109, thank you.
1020|Picoric, thank you.
1021|Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?
1022|Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.
1023|It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.
1024|Um...
1025|Amidoko kamsamita!
1026|Ah, come on way up.
1027|Fates, thank you.
1028|Yo, yo, yo.
1029|I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.
1030|Amazing sand, thank you.
1031|Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing
1032|for next year's Crunchyroll convention,
1033|but it did seem like a lot of fun,
1034|especially I just tweeted something before the stream.
1035|Everybody's like, ame, ame.
1036|And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.
1037|A small ame was there dancing.
1038|Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.
1039|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1040|It doesn't have to be, you know,
1041|only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.
1042|Um...
1043|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1044|Super Sunday time.
1045|Stratus fight, thank you.
1046|Immediates, thank you.
1047|Bus, thank you.
1048|You can get a degree at the panel the other day.
1049|Thanks so well.
1050|How different was it singing
1051|and being able to watch the crowd?
1052|Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...
1053|Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,
1054|I wasn't watching the crowd
1055|because I was looking at the lyrics.
1056|But, um, yeah, like I said,
1057|watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.
1058|Mm-hmm.
1059|And Smart Boy, thank you.
1060|Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.
1061|Puru put it in at this point.
1062|But you just don't know.
1063|I just wanted to make sure I got it right.
1064|Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.
1065|That'd be cool.
1066|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1067|Tried making amine last night.
1068|It tasted pretty good.
1069|Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.
1070|I'm glad you liked it.
1071|Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.
1072|Aww.
1073|Oh, thank you.
1074|Thank you for the question.
1075|I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.
1076|I-R-L.
1077|Mm-hmm.
1078|Yeah, I'm done.
1079|Mm-hmm.
1080|Yesterday, I got something to do.
1081|This song sounds...
1082|This song sounds kind of sad.
1083|But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.
1084|Alpha 9 5 7 1.
1085|Ooh.
1086|Cool.
1087|Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.
1088|Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.
1089|Thank you.
1090|Thank you.
1091|Thank you.
1092|Aww, thank you.
1093|I'm glad you enjoyed.
1094|Wait.
1095|Thank you.
1096|I'll see you laughing.
1097|Thank you.
1098|Ask Pei.
1099|Thank you.
1100|Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?
1101|Maybe, perhaps?
1102|Uh, I think it's an affiliate.
1103|I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.
1104|Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.
1105|So, I'll, uh, get started on that.
1106|Mm-hmm.
1107|Ifmefa, thank you.
1108|Oh.
1109|Aww, thank you.
1110|Aww, thank you.
1111|Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.
1112|Esta ludos desde Chile.
1113|Oh, Chile.
1114|Very chill.
1115|Muchas gracias.
1116|Anti-whippy, thank you.
1117|It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.
1118|She even became Ian's old mascot.
1119|You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?
1120|Oh.
1121|Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.
1122|I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.
1123|So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.
1124|You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.
1125|So, yeah.
1126|But, yeah, it is really crazy.
1127|It is surprising.
1128|But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,
1129|and people started using them in memes.
1130|So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.
1131|She's, like, 40 now.
1132|Small Aime is the real idol here.
1133|Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.
1134|What do you guys think?
1135|Oh, there's an idea.
1136|Hey, I can do it on my own.
1137|Well, not all alone, but...
1138|Huh.
1139|All right, well, stay tuned.
1140|Flynn Playmable, thank you.
1141|Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.
1142|TK, thank you.
1143|First, Akka Super Chat.
1144|Oh, that was a solid one.
1145|Thank you so much, TK.
1146|Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.
1147|Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.
1148|Thank you.
1149|At TotoCubes, thank you.
1150|Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?
1151|Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.
1152|Me too.
1153|Last time, 39. Thank you.
1154|The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.
1155|It looks so good.
1156|Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.
1157|Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?
1158|Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...
1159|Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.
1160|Right next, thank you.
1161|Does Mama get put back in the box?
1162|Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.
1163|I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?
1164|At TK, thank you.
1165|Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.
1166|Aw.
1167|Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.
1168|I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.
1169|Thank you, thank you for the support.
1170|Thank you.
1171|Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.
1172|I'm in it all night.
1173|Rock the gas bar. Rock the...
1174|Lock the taskbar.
1175|All right, dear. Thank you.
1176|Yeah.
1177|It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...
1178|You know, I think she's getting better.
1179|I think she's improving a little bit.
1180|Uh, Lynn, thank you.
1181|YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.
1182|There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,
1183|and even has a shark egg.
1184|Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,
1185|fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.
1186|Watch me put them in.
1187|And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,
1188|what's up, fish heads?
1189|And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.
1190|And it's not even that cool when you see it.
1191|I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...
1192|They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,
1193|really high-quality videos of their tanks.
1194|And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,
1195|and there's, like, relaxing music, so...
1196|That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.
1197|Uh, Kram, thank you so much!
1198|Another big substitute!
1199|It just says,
1200|I'm in!
1201|Thank you so much for the support.
1202|TK, the third big super check!
1203|Thank you so much!
1204|Huh?
1205|Aww, thank you, TK.
1206|So sweet!
1207|I see another one here, but TK, again.
1208|Here, look, he's always so fun.
1209|Game streams, always entertaining.
1210|Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,
1211|but his stream is so comfy,
1212|and video stream projects always spark excitement.
1213|Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!
1214|Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1215|So sweet!
1216|Thank you so much!
1217|I really appreciate it.
1218|I'm glad, uh, you know,
1219|at the end of the day,
1220|if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,
1221|I'm happy, so thank you.
1222|And Majin D, thank you!
1223|Majin 8, thank you!
1224|I'll see you in the bar!
1225|Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,
1226|I hope you get there safe.
1227|I hope you win the lottery one day for the...
1228|not just the regular lottery,
1229|the main green lottery, I guess.
1230|Uh, right here!
1231|Thank you!
1232|Endless Ame!
1233|Only around Halloween.
1234|Rock the guest box!
1235|Ame, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee!
1236|Uh, Roger Liao, thank you!
1237|Ame, ame, ame, ame, ame!
1238|A12 Flames.
1239|Thank you!
1240|Oh!
1241|Oh, the deep skies nuts!
1242|Yeah, that was a tweet that I read during the panel.
1243|Thank you for the question!
1244|Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1245|Oh my god, this song is really loud.
1246|Okay.
1247|Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.
1248|Uh, where was I?
1249|Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1250|Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.
1251|Uh-huh.
1252|Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!
1253|Oh!
1254|Uh, thank you so much!
1255|Thank you!
1256|I hope you also have a yummy food!
1257|Mm-hmm!
1258|Thank you so much for all the support.
1259|I appreciate it.
1260|Nagi!
1261|Oh, thank you!
1262|Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!
1263|Oh, it was really sweet!
1264|Thank you so much!
1265|Nagi's so cute!
1266|So cute!
1267|Yeah, we got some pictures together.
1268|Thank you, thank you for all your support.
1269|I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.
1270|Thank you!
1271|So many cute teammates!
1272|Thank you!
1273|Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.
1274|Did I have any input for the figure?
1275|Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,
1276|but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.
1277|I think it was for that one.
1278|Mm-hmm.
1279|Aaron Pampo, thank you!
1280|Happy birthday!
1281|This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.
1282|Ooh, an amé party!
1283|Dang, amé cake!
1284|Amé day!
1285|No, just kidding.
1286|I hope the cake was tasty.
1287|I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.
1288|Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!
1289|I hope you have a good rest of the day.
1290|Night!
1291|Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?
1292|Amé cake?
1293|Mm-hmm, amé party!
1294|Very cool.
1295|A flag armor, thank you!
1296|I'll be out of blackberries!
1297|No, no, they're still on the...
1298|They left them on the counter, they're still there!
1299|Eduardo, thank you!
1300|Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.
1301|Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?
1302|Did I say that?
1303|Oh...
1304|I don't remember.
1305|Uh...
1306|Yes, just assume that...
1307|Yes, uh-huh.
1308|I could be at 9-9, thank you!
1309|Um, many times, thank you!
1310|Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,
1311|because, you know, the people around you,
1312|if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,
1313|but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,
1314|at least have heard of it.
1315|Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,
1316|so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.
1317|Mm-hmm!
1318|Xinyoung-ho!
1319|Thank you!
1320|Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!
1321|Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,
1322|aim for 22 games in 2022?
1323|How many do I need left?
1324|How many left are there that I need to complete?
1325|I think it's possible, what?
1326|How many months?
1327|We still have 5 months.
1328|I think it's possible.
1329|20 more to go! 19?
1330|Well, I have some shorter games.
1331|Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,
1332|that I think we could do.
1333|But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,
1334|and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,
1335|Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.
1336|I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.
1337|And I know, um,
1338|there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,
1339|but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,
1340|and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,
1341|and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,
1342|like a platform or something, like a 2D.
1343|Ooh, I did want to play, um...
1344|Hey!
1345|What was that one game?
1346|I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.
1347|Uh...
1348|Crash Bandicoot!
1349|Yeah, I'm gonna play.
1350|Stray? I don't know, it looks...
1351|It looks cute, but I don't know.
1352|Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
1353|Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...
1354|Switch?
1355|Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,
1356|I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,
1357|it seems like a game that would take me a while.
1358|Uh...
1359|It is?
1360|Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?
1361|We'll see.
1362|Uh, Multi, thank you.
1363|Aww...
1364|Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.
1365|Mm-hmm.
1366|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1367|Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity
1368|to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.
1369|Mm-hmm.
1370|Anyways, thank you.
1371|Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.
1372|I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.
1373|Have a snack.
1374|Maybe I'll make a sandwich.
1375|Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.
1376|Um, what do you mean, what?
1377|Huh?
1378|Go to start, thank you.
1379|Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.
1380|Agent Quirobo, thank you.
1381|Gracias.
1382|Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.
1383|Would there be a post for the schedule this week?
1384|Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.
1385|I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.
1386|Mm-hmm.
1387|I think I will post something.
1388|I don't know yet.
1389|If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,
1390|like 24 hours before.
1391|Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.
1392|Mm-hmm.
1393|Semen 2016, oh, thank you.
1394|I hope you're having a good day too.
1395|Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed
1396|the Eurotruck sim stream.
1397|You mean?
1398|Yasami-ka!
1399|Thank you.
1400|Antipi, thank you.
1401|Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays
1402|might be a good way to help fill out the week.
1403|Possibly.
1404|That is true.
1405|Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.
1406|I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.
1407|I keep forgetting.
1408|Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.
1409|It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams
1410|that I've done on there, and I will upload them there
1411|for archive reasons.
1412|Archival, is that a word?
1413|Uh...
1414|Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?
1415|No, Bart, thank you.
1416|Where's Super Chat?
1417|Sorry, we do pops here.
1418|I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it
1419|like a, say something bad or something.
1420|Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.
1421|Twitch sucks!
1422|Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective
1423|good to stream every now and then.
1424|Okay, like imagine this.
1425|Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,
1426|and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.
1427|Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.
1428|Now, of course there's discoverability,
1429|you know, possible within YouTube,
1430|and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,
1431|our whole audience is on YouTube.
1432|But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,
1433|a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,
1434|okay, you could have one person
1435|streaming their perspective on Twitch,
1436|and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.
1437|That's business, baby!
1438|But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming
1439|like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,
1440|it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,
1441|I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.
1442|I don't know.
1443|Maybe it's just all in my head.
1444|I gotta check the statistics.
1445|Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.
1446|How about that?
1447|What was the other one?
1448|Video motion.
1449|Thank you.
1450|Thank you.
1451|Oh, gracias.
1452|The motherfucking workers, thank you.
1453|Nanji Misa, arigato.
1454|Ame-chan, kawaii.
1455|Thank you.
1456|Arigato.
1457|Shadowfire, thank you.
1458|Oh, muchas gracias.
1459|Nice.
1460|Ellen Saputro.
1461|Thank you.
1462|Oh, Arowanas.
1463|Yeah, they look cool.
1464|I like them when they're small, when they're babies,
1465|but Arowana is a type of fish.
1466|They get big.
1467|They get really big, and they'll bite you,
1468|and you can bleed and stuff.
1469|It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank
1470|for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.
1471|Boi-boo, boi-boo.
1472|They're so cute when they're small,
1473|because their eyes are really big.
1474|Let me see if I can show a picture.
1475|Whoa, what is this?
1476|They have this sack.
1477|A weird sack.
1478|What is this weird sack that they have?
1479|I'll show you this picture.
1480|Oh, see, they're so cute.
1481|Yeah, they're expensive.
1482|See, they have this little weird sack.
1483|Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?
1484|Because it looks like only the babies have them.
1485|What is that?
1486|They're born with it?
1487|A digestion sack?
1488|Yeah, they get really big, though.
1489|Let's see, fully grown.
1490|Here.
1491|Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.
1492|This is good for perspective.
1493|I don't know who that is,
1494|but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.
1495|Wait, this looks like Photoshop.
1496|No, it's not real.
1497|It's a clickbait image.
1498|They're not that big.
1499|Let's see if I can find a better picture.
1500|Okay, this is a good one.
1501|Bim, bam, bim, bam.
1502|Oh, my God.
1503|Okay.
1504|Okay.
1505|Yeah.
1506|Yeah, they're cute.
1507|Cute, cute.
1508|Omega hot dog.
1509|Thank you.
1510|What do you call an omega that makes gluten-filled bread?
1511|A Watsonburg dishes baking bed.

1519|Thank you.
1520|I saw a small omelet at this event.
1521|I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.
1522|Yago was also there.
1523|Didn't do anything to him, right?
1524|Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?
1525|Or since earlier today?
1526|Suss.
1527|Suss.
1528|Maka, thank you.
1529|This is a big super chat.
1530|If you don't remember backstaters,
1531|don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.
1532|Let me see.
1533|Grindings like neon white.
1534|Hmm?
1535|Yeah, we'll see.
1536|I just feel like for people watching,
1537|maybe it's like repetitive or something.
1538|I do think it is pretty fun, though.
1539|I don't really mind backstating neon white
1540|because I don't even look at chat
1541|unless I ask you guys a question.
1542|I'm sorry, boy.
1543|Thank you.
1544|Ryan, Quebec.
1545|Thank you.

1577|Always.
1578|AirW1, thank you.
1579|Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?
1580|Three fish got battered.
1581|Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?
1582|Oh, I like that one.
1583|That's a good one.
1584|Okay, P-back.
1585|I see.
1586|I see.
1587|Okay.
1588|Hi, Gavin Dorff.
1589|Thank you.
1590|I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.
1591|What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?
1592|I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.
1593|Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.
1594|Something like that?
1595|Oh, what are they called?
1596|Dragon?
1597|Dragon days?
1598|No.
1599|Sea dragons.
1600|Yeah, sea dragons.
1601|And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.
1602|Pipefish, I think?
1603|They're so cute.
1604|Oh, garden eels.
1605|Yeah, I like seeing those types.
1606|Seahorses especially.
1607|You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater
1608|person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses
1609|had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses
1610|in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they
1611|give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue
1612|inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the
1613|tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.
1614|It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.
1615|So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the
1616|seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like
1617|where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels
1618|so that the seahorse can swim normally again.
1619|So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary
1620|to do.
1621|And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.
1622|Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.
1623|Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they
1624|like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like
1625|a build up of gas.
1626|Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.
1627|Mm-hmm.
1628|It's scary.
1629|What does that happen to us?
1630|Maybe it does.
1631|All right.
1632|Hello, thank you.
1633|Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.
1634|Yeah, thank you.
1635|Happy early international cat day to Wellington Henry.
1636|Oh cute, what is that?

1655|That'll one, thank you.
1656|Can I hire Smalmed to come to my birthday party?
1657|That'd be funny.
1658|I'll keep them as a backup plan, yes.
1659|I'll tell Smalmed that could be a good backup plan.
1660|A Vtuber fan, thank you.
1661|Oh, shout out to, I don't know about that, but I really appreciate all the support to
1662|a Vtuber fan, thank you.
1663|Thank you.
1664|Thank you.
1665|Thank you.
1666|Thank you.
1667|You're my main inspiration for becoming a Vtuber, I hope that one day we could collab,
1668|even though the odds are probably super low.
1669|Well, good luck.
1670|It's good to have goals.
1671|Sweet.
1672|Cool, I hope it works out.
1673|For a Kuma Forever one, thank you.

1686|Well, we'll see.
1687|We'll see this week, maybe.
1688|Vek, thank you.
1689|A red arrow one now.
1690|All right, let's show the class.
1691|Red arrow one now.
1692|Oh, this looks like a fish who could catch an animal crossing.
1693|Oh, I forgot this image was up here.
1694|Mmm, pretty.
1695|It looks like a big betta fish.
1696|Yeah, very bright colored.
1697|Cute.
1698|They're chunky.
1699|Very chunky.
1700|This is a caption on this one.
1701|It's transporting a rare arrow one.
1702|You can see how big it is compared to the arms.
1703|Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.
1704|300 or more.
1705|Hot Cheeto fish.
1706|Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.
1707|Okay, stamps.
1708|This is the last Super Chat.
1709|Don't send it anymore.
1710|If you do, just know that I'm not going to read it.
1711|This is the last Super Chat.
1712|Can I say, thanks so much.
1713|I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,
1714|even though they're not as long as they used to be,
1715|but we get a nice condensed version.
1716|And we have time for other stuff later.
1717|All right, well, you guys have six minutes.
1718|Let me go open up steam.
1719|Uh-huh.
1720|Four titties.
1721|Titties.
1722|30 bucks.
1723|I'll make it back.
1724|Wait, should I get Cities Skyline Deluxe Edition?
1725|Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.
1726|And Harbor means $10 more.
1727|Get the Deluxe.
1728|All right.
1729|Fine.
1730|All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream
1731|because I'm paranoid.
1732|Okay, it's in the cards, though.
1733|All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?
1734|Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.
1735|Oh, my God.
1736|Swimsuit wallpaper.
1737|I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,
1738|which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.
1739|But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.
1740|Oh, no, I'm a doko.
1741|Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.
1742|Yeah, that went well, right?
1743|Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.
1744|I'm going to take a break.
1745|I'm going to clean up an area where I made a mess.
1746|And then I'm going to have a snack.
1747|And then I have to install Cities Skyline, so yes.
1748|Oh, just in time.

32|It looks
33|somewhat normal, okay
34|My immersion, oh no, oh you'll live you'll live
35|Oh
36|Man I was gonna bring berries
37|I was gonna bring berries to the stream. I had blackberries and I left them in the kitchen
38|Well, I get them later. Yes, uh, Baba is already on although there's no song requests open
39|I'm gonna open up the song cue now
40|Give me one a moment
41|How can you add songs great question
42|well
43|you would do exclamation point SR which stands for song request and then put the link of the song you would like to request in
44|in the chat of Bubba, but
45|Which I don't remember the
46|Command is it working? Oh
47|Hold on, let me check something really quick one sec
48|You
49|Okay, now Bubba about his playing can you guys hear it sorry I had to hold on
50|Okay
51|Okay, yeah, it's loud okay, I'll turn down a little bit
52|Okay, turn it down is that better
53|You can hear now, okay cool. So yeah, the key is already open and it fills up really fast because you guys are like
54|robots
55|Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm
56|Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know
57|I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm
58|Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream
59|But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed
60|And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out
61|So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub
62|It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower
63|Mm-hmm
64|Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle
65|So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably
66|I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover
67|Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins
68|They're pretty good. I think I
69|Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I
70|Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead
71|Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a
72|It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you
73|Where is it, um
74|Let's see
75|Okay
76|Weird hold on let me cut there for a second
77|Oh
78|Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?
79|Disappeared
80|The office is gone
81|Doesn't make any sense
82|Don't make no sense. Wait
83|There's that
84|It's probably just like an OBS problem
85|Oh
86|What if I duplicate
87|All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh
88|Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here
89|Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office
90|I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect
91|We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh
92|And it's like it looks 3d
93|Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else

119|Oh
120|Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you
121|Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank
122|Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about
123|Oh
124|You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs
125|I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to
126|Just to like go outside and talk
127|with person at the store
128|But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream
129|I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I
130|Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just
131|Not healthy for my tummy. Oh
132|What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule
133|Oh
134|Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up
135|For the next
136|The next coming this coming week, let's see
137|I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was
138|Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday
139|Wait, yes, it was a Monday
140|No
141|It was on Tuesday
142|Okay, okay
143|Sorry, sorry
144|Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule
145|sort of
146|Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring
147|starting at AMT time and
148|Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think
149|So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier
150|So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week
151|Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet
152|If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream
153|I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream
154|So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know
155|I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and
156|Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring
157|I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark
158|So I'm not sure
159|If it's gonna be on that day
160|But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh
161|Then on Friday
162|What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one
163|Keep having to refresh it every time
164|Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now
165|I
166|I
167|I
168|Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something
169|That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing
170|All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday
171|We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again
172|Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some
173|Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it
174|Is that like a bird an alarm
175|Alright super chats from
176|Five days ago got it. Oh
177|But before we read super chat, she's gonna see look look look wait
178|Oh
179|Look at this wait, it's too big
180|Hold on oh
181|It's gone and disappeared what the heck
182|Oh
183|It's gone oh
184|Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today
185|Look at the starfish
186|Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank
187|But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it
188|Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose
189|to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so
190|Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass
191|It's cute, right?
192|You can see the mouth in the center there
193|Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy
194|Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the
195|You know the land
196|The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to
197|Yeah, both it's both weird
198|Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small
199|so small and then also
200|Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small
201|This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought
202|It's um
203|Can I use the point?
204|It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer
205|like a little cursor to drag around the screen
206|Alright, I'll point with
207|This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone
208|I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and
209|the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and
210|Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?
211|it's
212|Okay, the video was unavailable
213|Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned
214|I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh
215|Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is
216|It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning
217|They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab
218|Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting
219|things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and
220|In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone
221|So they have like a really cute relationship
222|Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them
223|Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm
224|Now you could see it
225|It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything
226|This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too
227|Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it
228|Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color
229|Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it
230|But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm
231|So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know
232|I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing
233|So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and
234|Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm
235|But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it
236|I want to protect it
237|Yeah, this a anemone
238|It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute
239|They're so cute. And then
240|And then let me see, hold on
241|Hold on
242|Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in
243|Okay, now I will show you guys
244|The frog
245|After I change something really quick
246|Um
247|This one
248|Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm
249|You frog
250|Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up
251|All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels
252|There's one of the frogs
253|Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um
254|He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water
255|They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air
256|And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air
257|Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together
258|But let me see
259|No, this is the only picture I have actually
260|Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again
261|Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them
262|Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny
263|Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out
264|Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space
265|Yeah, we'll see
266|Look at them. I need to zoom in
267|Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them
268|But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams
269|Seems cute
270|What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets
271|They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face
272|They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning
273|And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing
274|So it was getting a mouthful of sand
275|Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it
276|No, they don't usually bother shrimp
277|Not that I've seen anyway
278|I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth
279|But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything
280|I
281|Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys
282|Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted
283|But it doesn't look like we have too much to go
284|I didn't have to scroll too much to get down to these super chats now reading from the apex collab with a mume

305|I'm not that good at FPS games. I think I have my moments in like FPS games
306|But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good
307|I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well
308|Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates
309|They start messing around in the game
310|Yeah, it's it's well
311|It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to

341|I have to be tapped into the game to
342|Well, I could put it on a hotkey
343|Yeah, I could put it on a hockey like uh, I
344|Guess it would be like this. Hold on. Let me see I can show you guys a demonstration if you will
345|Like that it would be just like that. Yeah, I'll put it on a hockey. That's a good idea. Thanks. I'm it

352|I don't really have cravings for chips
353|Yeah
354|It's a lessons. Thank you
355|And new a sign I got dog
356|Can you stay I was a thank you. I shoot a sucky. Thank you gentlemen
357|Thank you. Oh, yeah, I learned something today
358|Well, it was like while I was reading
359|researching some stuff
360|Apparently if you guys look at your nails right now
361|Do you guys have like a little white half moon at the bottom part of your nail where it like connects to your finger?
362|Do you guys have that check check?
363|everybody check
364|Yes, yes, yep, nope. No. Yes. Yes
365|Yeah, it's called the wait. I forget what it's called Luna lei. I think Luna lei
366|Uh-huh. Yeah, it means yet. It means if you're missing it, it might mean that you have
367|issues with like nutrition or vitamins
368|Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name
369|Yeah, it's called a Luna lei
370|Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and
371|And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions
372|It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways
373|But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something
374|That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I
375|Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe
376|Oh
377|That's good, maybe my I guess my feet are healthier
378|Yeah, yeah looking at look up it's like when you can tell what color it's like the color of stuff that comes out of your
379|Body indicates, you know like things in your body, right?
380|Yeah, I'm all nervous from lack of I'm a
381|Okay, okay. Oh, yeah, I like this song nice. Okay. Oh, where was I reading super chats back to super chats?
382|Pick a right thing here. Oh, that would be cool. I need toe. Thank you. It is named on sites with fuse old for six times
383|zoom, oh
384|I want to play more fuse
385|Is the season starting again soon on apex? Maybe I'll give it the good old try
386|I'll try hard
387|We'll see I
388|Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it
389|It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch
390|It takes less time. Well, I don't know
391|I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex
392|Maybe it's not that much time
393|But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die
394|Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though
395|Hmm
396|Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something
397|Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob
398|Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh
399|Okay
400|Sorry, I have this like leftover
401|Skin bubble from a blister. I just felt that you

571|No.
572|You guys didn't hear anything.
573|Okay, it's only for a second.
574|Yeah, we'll be fine.
575|Test.
576|Test.
577|Okay, does it sound better now?
578|Okay.
579|I think there's just some weird discrepancy
580|between the hardware and the software.
581|Wait, does it work now?
582|Super Chat!
583|Thank you!
584|Okay, I think it's because I had my PC on,
585|but sometimes I like disconnect the GoXLR or something.
586|Or, Henry disconnects it.
587|Okay.
588|I'm gonna fix something.
589|Test.
590|No, no, no, no, no.
591|Take me to the eye of your mind.
592|Don't you know you might find a better place to play?
593|Okay.
594|I'm smart boy, thank you.
595|Small Amet earned her trucking license fair and square.
596|Very good, thank you.
597|I could be gonna know, thank you.
598|Hey, she said the things I had went to my head.
599|I've been back with someone down in New York.
600|Stand up beside the bonfire,
601|and then look from up your face.
602|You ain't ever going to burn my heart out.
603|Thank you, but correct, thank you.
604|Small Amet caused a multitude of accidents
605|on that fateful day.
606|What is that, thank you.
607|Tenet, thank you.
608|A stratify, thank you.

613|Amet, thank you.
614|Oh, thank you for your dedication, Amet, thank you.
615|Nobody knows if it's night or day.
616|Oh, wow.
617|Mess me up, thank you.
618|This is the start of revolution from my bed.
619|Cause she said the things I had went to my head.
620|Small Amet's gonna drive a truck,
621|she's too small to see through the windshield.
622|Yes, yes, no, Small Amet had a booster seat.
623|Yeah, it was okay.
624|Take that look from off your face.
625|See, you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out.
626|And some girl we can't wait.
627|She knows it's too late.
628|Well, yeah, go to side, oh, thank you.
629|Thank you, Small Amet, cause you reached the pedal.
630|I think she had some sort of set up where she had like a peg
631|leg kind of strapped to one of her legs.
632|A pickle rig, thank you.
633|Instead of please step on me, Amet,
634|please run me over, Small Amet.
635|Yeah, must yes, thank you.
636|I'm sorry, it'd be an honor to be is a kind by these Small Amet.

644|Slow Tam, thank you, the Isekai Express, whoa, whoa.
645|Half wing, thank you.
646|Delorean truck, cool.
647|Bus, thank you.
648|Did you order some of the Omoket and Council Iris merch?
649|Which ones would you get?
650|I did, I got the main one.
651|And I think I got Mumei's,
652|because I liked how kind of subtle it was.
653|And then also Fauna's sweater.
654|And, oh, that was cool.
655|I get it for free.
656|I don't order Mumei's birthday merch.
657|I think I'm, I think I'm done ordering people's merch,
658|because I always forget.
659|It always, well, I get like a ton of emails
660|from before the haul.
661|Does that still happen with the Hololive shop
662|where if you order merch, like it gives you an email
663|and it's like, it's at a warehouse.
664|Please pay, blah, blah, blah, blah.
665|And I'm just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
666|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
667|Yeah, Fauna's sweater is so cute.
668|Not from the official store.
669|Okay, because I have a ton of stuff that I got from Byee
670|and it was, well, they have extras now, I guess.
671|I mean, it's still mine, it's so, you know,
672|I just like supported them, I guess.
673|I just never got the item.
674|Ah, ah, ah.
675|Magic, magic.
676|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
677|Oh, is this a sign, you guys want me to sing this song
678|for karaoke?
679|Magic.
680|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
681|It's magic, magic.
682|I can't read, it's too small.
683|All I have to do is think of you
684|to make the music start to play.
685|Then I dance from down the street and I'm, I can't read.
686|Hey, hey, hey, magic ways.
687|Ooh, you love the girl with magic ways.
688|And it's true.
689|Oh, I can't read, it's too small.
690|The text is too small, I'm struggling here.
691|Okay.
692|Night and night and oh, sweet magic ways.
693|Oh, where was I?
694|Oh, Ricardo, thank you.
695|Oh, Reginald, thank you.
696|Oh, I want to translate this one.
697|Magic, magic.
698|Thank you, thank you, thank you profile, so cute.
699|Must be my new YouTube, I want to say Yo YouTube.
700|My new YouTube profile picture, thank you.
701|I think that it was the, well,
702|I was just like looking through Pixel
703|and I was trying so many different pictures
704|and like it's just that, you know,
705|having blonde hair and being super pale,
706|it's kind of hard with contrast,
707|like to find a good image that contrasts properly
708|for like a small profile picture.
709|So I was just Googling my name
710|and looking through the images and I found this one
711|and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images
712|I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.
713|So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.
714|So I decided to keep it.
715|Magic, magic.
716|Oh, right dude, thank you.
717|Yuste, kam samita.
718|I ate Amaz menu at a collaboration cafe yesterday.
719|It was really good.
720|Hope there'll be more events like this next time.
721|Oh, thank you, kam samita, kam amo yo.
722|Yeah, about the cafe in Korea.
723|And yeah, I saw like what Kyara shared,
724|like some pictures of some very dedicated
725|Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,
726|like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.
727|I think they were camping out like at midnight,
728|waiting for it to open
729|because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.
730|So take some dedication, you know.
731|It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout
732|for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.
733|Yeah, they're very dedicated
734|and they seem really happy too.
735|I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.
736|It'd be awesome.
737|Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,
738|but still.
739|Yeah, that's true.
740|They keep underestimating us.
741|When will they learn?
742|Psycho, thank you.
743|Oh, some coins, thank you.
744|Pick a ring, thank you.
745|Oh yeah, I saw.
746|Was there like for real GTA six announcement?
747|Or was it like a leak or something?
748|I'm ending things, I know.
749|Oh, it's real.
750|They're working on it.
751|Didn't it take like 10 years for GTA five
752|or some like really long amount?
753|Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
754|Cool, I definitely played GTA six
755|when it comes out in four years.
756|Storm blade, thank you.
757|I believe Smulama did isekai some people on that.
758|Faithful day.
759|Storm, oh wait, right next, thank you.
760|YouTube crashed again, thank you.
761|I'm gonna get a close chat.
762|All right.
763|Where was I?
764|Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
765|Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
766|Thank you, the song is distracting.
767|TK, thank you.
768|Can you say I'm saying thank you?
769|Reindeer, thank you.
770|I'm a reed.
771|Thank you, some, oh, attack a goalie, thank you.
772|I almost said Smulama.
773|Yeah, investigators meeting, uh-huh, uh-huh.
774|Thank you for the support.
775|I didn't go, we didn't go, thank you.
776|Are we there yet?
777|I have to use the bathroom.
778|Bubba hit me, it's too hot.
779|Can we get McDonald's over there yet?
780|Shut up.
781|Aw, cute.
782|A new song, arigato.
783|Yejun, thank you.
784|Last time someone drew a picture of Smulama standing outside the big truck
785|fighting a piece of wheat straw,
786|does Smulama want to find someone's mother again?
787|Smulama's got a whole phone book,
788|whole of, uh, you know,
789|you know, uh, victims, nah, nah, nah.
790|Friends.
791|Smulama's got a lot of friends.
792|Or to the, thank you.
793|Thank you.
794|Halfwayang, thank you.
795|Yeah, GTA 5, the Europe map DLC.
796|Can I say I'm saying cute?
797|Taro Cube, saying cute.
798|Maybe trucker Smulama's license from the wrong timeline.
799|Yeah, I think so.
800|Yeah, it's not very valid here.
801|Airbumble, thank you.
802|Pickle Rick times two, thank you.
803|Boss music in Eurotrucks.
804|I guess there was as we were parking.
805|We have a day, thank you.
806|I'm glad you enjoyed the stream, thank you.
807|Thank you.
808|Thank you.
809|Yeah, everybody left the factory,
810|the carrot factory as Smulama was trying to deliver.
811|I guess it would be the, I don't know, processing plant maybe.
812|Uh-huh.
813|Damn, you could fit a lot of carrots in like a 22-foot long truck, huh?
814|Like tons and tons of carrots.
815|Whoa.
816|Okay, thank you.
817|This is harder than me landing on a sun station or parking a truck.
818|The sun station took way longer.
819|Mila, what's up, Detective Extraordinaire, thank you.
820|Hey, Solasos, thank you.
821|Wouldn't it be cool if truck sim had a Fallout mod?
822|It sounds very specific.
823|I guess it'd be more believable if Fallout had a truck sim mod.
824|Uh, Amadeus, thank you.
825|Hidezuki, thank you.
826|By color, thank you.
827|Up a creek, thank you.
828|Yeah, I'll just get a real truck and see how it is, how it really is.
829|Uh, Dunlides, thank you.
830|Uh, Slotham, thank you.
831|Nice boat, thank you.
832|Isute, Kamsamita.
833|Wait, is this what it says? Let me double check.
834|Okay, Multi, thank you.
835|Wajaleo, thank you.
836|Twilight, thank you.
837|Fishstar, thank you.
838|Alright, only about 20% left of the superchets, including the ones from the stream.
839|Itchy.
840|Hold on.
841|Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
842|It's a guy's simulator, I like that.
843|Uh, Rekukun, thank you.
844|Um, A screen, thank you.
845|Truckson.
846|Can I say it? So thank you.
847|Thank you for watching.
848|Kamsamita.
849|Kamsamita.
850|Jiho, komawa yo.
851|Mayscreen, thank you.
852|Aw, thank you.
853|Kuristai, thank you.
854|Alright, now superchets from two days ago. What did we do two days ago?
855|Oh, wait, is this from the free chat? Oh, no.
856|Okay, I guess there's some from the free chat and then some from the today stream.
857|Kuristai, thank you.
858|Oh, Rekukun, thank you.
859|I'm at Crunchyroll Expo for the next two days.
860|I'll be the vlogging. Oh, nice.
861|Did I stream? I don't remember.
862|Just in time, thank you.
863|I hope you enjoyed the convention.
864|Oh, karaoke.
865|Rekukun, thank you.
866|Oh, oh, yes.
867|It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,
868|but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,
869|I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,
870|close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert
871|and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short
872|because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.
873|Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?
874|Aw, cool.
875|Yeah, it was really cool.
876|I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,
877|so her voice was not that great.
878|She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,
879|so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,
880|but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,
881|it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?
882|And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.
883|It's so cool.
884|Mm-hmm, so magical.
885|Aw, where was I?
886|Aw, I made me a thank you.
887|How was it to meet some of your fans?
888|I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,
889|so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,
890|well, how was your convention going?
891|Did you see the KFP stand?
892|I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?
893|Did you see the Artist Alley?
894|How many did I meet?
895|I think, I don't know the exact number,
896|but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.
897|I think a little bit more than 20.
898|Aw, okay, good, thank you.
899|I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.
900|Good, it's a bad influence.
901|Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.
902|It was just some guy in the crowd.
903|Ms. Mint, thank you.
904|Yeah, we made a thank you.
905|Can I ask about the coin purse?
906|It's super cute and I want one.
907|I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,
908|like a long time ago.
909|Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.
910|Pickle Rick, thank you.
911|Next meeting greets, yeah.
912|I wouldn't mind doing them as often.
913|This is convention season still right now,
914|but during convention season I don't mind doing it.
915|It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.
916|I think doing the panel was more difficult
917|than doing the meeting greets because,
918|well, usually in the past when we do panels,
919|there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC
920|who deals with handling the crowd
921|and asking questions and things like that
922|and just keeping the flow going for the panel,
923|but because it was up to each of us,
924|Good and I were talking about different ideas
925|that we could do for the panel,
926|and we just didn't come to a conclusion
927|of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.
928|I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,
929|and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.
930|So we had a lot of ideas,
931|but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,
932|like, oh, just, you know, questions.
933|MeTuber support, okay.
934|It was easy.
935|And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,
936|so I really wanted to, you know,
937|work with that too and do a little musical thing.
938|Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.
939|I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.
940|If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.
941|If I could even get that effect in OBS,
942|which it kind of worked.
943|I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.
944|I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.
945|But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll
946|if we could hand out.
947|I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.
948|If we could hand out like blue and red,
949|those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,
950|something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.
951|I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.
952|You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.
953|But I think it was too last minute anyways.
954|Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.
955|I don't even know how that would be possible.
956|I know you can rent 3D glasses.
957|You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,
958|but those work differently.
959|It's like it takes...
960|Hmm.
961|I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.
962|It like polarizes light circularly.
963|And so what it is, is like when you're watching
964|one of those 3D movies in theaters,
965|is they have like two projectors going,
966|or one that switches really fast back and forth,
967|and they're polarized.
968|Circularly polarized in opposite directions,
969|and each lens only allows one directional,
970|one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.
971|I think I get it.
972|Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.
973|Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.
974|Unless we had a special projector.
975|It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.
976|How do they work?
977|Um...
978|Okay, yeah, light wave physics.
979|It was interesting watching.
980|I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,
981|but this is like pretty complicated.
982|They like talking about, you know, the light waves
983|and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.
984|And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.
985|I don't even think I took a physics class.
986|Oh, no.
987|I kind of took a physics class, yeah.
988|Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.
989|Two YouTube tutorials later.
990|How do magnets work?
991|I don't know, how do they work?
992|It's magic.
993|Um...
994|Let's see.
995|Where was I?
996|Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.
997|Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,
998|I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,
999|I guess it sort of implied there might be something else
1000|coming up soon, so I don't know.
1001|I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,
1002|it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,
1003|but I'm not sure yet.
1004|Uh, no confirmations yet.
1005|Uh, Vercatos, thank you.
1006|Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.
1007|My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember
1008|some of the anime that I really liked.
1009|So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked
1010|and that I remembered that I liked,
1011|but I think there's some anime that I really liked too
1012|that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.
1013|Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?
1014|Congratulations!
1015|A marriage, whoa!
1016|Nice, thank you for the support.
1017|I hope they have a successful marriage.
1018|Marriage.
1019|SS109, thank you.
1020|Picoric, thank you.
1021|Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?
1022|Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.
1023|It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.
1024|Um...
1025|Amidoko kamsamita!
1026|Ah, come on way up.
1027|Fates, thank you.
1028|Yo, yo, yo.
1029|I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.
1030|Amazing sand, thank you.
1031|Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing
1032|for next year's Crunchyroll convention,
1033|but it did seem like a lot of fun,
1034|especially I just tweeted something before the stream.
1035|Everybody's like, ame, ame.
1036|And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.
1037|A small ame was there dancing.
1038|Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.
1039|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1040|It doesn't have to be, you know,
1041|only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.
1042|Um...
1043|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1044|Super Sunday time.
1045|Stratus fight, thank you.
1046|Immediates, thank you.
1047|Bus, thank you.
1048|You can get a degree at the panel the other day.
1049|Thanks so well.
1050|How different was it singing
1051|and being able to watch the crowd?
1052|Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...
1053|Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,
1054|I wasn't watching the crowd
1055|because I was looking at the lyrics.
1056|But, um, yeah, like I said,
1057|watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.
1058|Mm-hmm.
1059|And Smart Boy, thank you.
1060|Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.
1061|Puru put it in at this point.
1062|But you just don't know.
1063|I just wanted to make sure I got it right.
1064|Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.
1065|That'd be cool.
1066|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1067|Tried making amine last night.
1068|It tasted pretty good.
1069|Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.
1070|I'm glad you liked it.
1071|Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.
1072|Aww.
1073|Oh, thank you.
1074|Thank you for the question.
1075|I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.
1076|I-R-L.
1077|Mm-hmm.
1078|Yeah, I'm done.
1079|Mm-hmm.
1080|Yesterday, I got something to do.
1081|This song sounds...
1082|This song sounds kind of sad.
1083|But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.
1084|Alpha 9 5 7 1.
1085|Ooh.
1086|Cool.
1087|Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.
1088|Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.
1089|Thank you.
1090|Thank you.
1091|Thank you.
1092|Aww, thank you.
1093|I'm glad you enjoyed.
1094|Wait.
1095|Thank you.
1096|I'll see you laughing.
1097|Thank you.
1098|Ask Pei.
1099|Thank you.
1100|Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?
1101|Maybe, perhaps?
1102|Uh, I think it's an affiliate.
1103|I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.
1104|Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.
1105|So, I'll, uh, get started on that.
1106|Mm-hmm.
1107|Ifmefa, thank you.
1108|Oh.
1109|Aww, thank you.
1110|Aww, thank you.
1111|Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.
1112|Esta ludos desde Chile.
1113|Oh, Chile.
1114|Very chill.
1115|Muchas gracias.
1116|Anti-whippy, thank you.
1117|It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.
1118|She even became Ian's old mascot.
1119|You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?
1120|Oh.
1121|Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.
1122|I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.
1123|So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.
1124|You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.
1125|So, yeah.
1126|But, yeah, it is really crazy.
1127|It is surprising.
1128|But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,
1129|and people started using them in memes.
1130|So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.
1131|She's, like, 40 now.
1132|Small Aime is the real idol here.
1133|Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.
1134|What do you guys think?
1135|Oh, there's an idea.
1136|Hey, I can do it on my own.
1137|Well, not all alone, but...
1138|Huh.
1139|All right, well, stay tuned.
1140|Flynn Playmable, thank you.
1141|Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.
1142|TK, thank you.
1143|First, Akka Super Chat.
1144|Oh, that was a solid one.
1145|Thank you so much, TK.
1146|Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.
1147|Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.
1148|Thank you.
1149|At TotoCubes, thank you.
1150|Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?
1151|Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.
1152|Me too.
1153|Last time, 39. Thank you.
1154|The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.
1155|It looks so good.
1156|Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.
1157|Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?
1158|Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...
1159|Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.
1160|Right next, thank you.
1161|Does Mama get put back in the box?
1162|Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.
1163|I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?
1164|At TK, thank you.
1165|Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.
1166|Aw.
1167|Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.
1168|I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.
1169|Thank you, thank you for the support.
1170|Thank you.
1171|Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.
1172|I'm in it all night.
1173|Rock the gas bar. Rock the...
1174|Lock the taskbar.
1175|All right, dear. Thank you.
1176|Yeah.
1177|It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...
1178|You know, I think she's getting better.
1179|I think she's improving a little bit.
1180|Uh, Lynn, thank you.
1181|YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.
1182|There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,
1183|and even has a shark egg.
1184|Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,
1185|fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.
1186|Watch me put them in.
1187|And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,
1188|what's up, fish heads?
1189|And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.
1190|And it's not even that cool when you see it.
1191|I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...
1192|They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,
1193|really high-quality videos of their tanks.
1194|And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,
1195|and there's, like, relaxing music, so...
1196|That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.
1197|Uh, Kram, thank you so much!
1198|Another big substitute!
1199|It just says,
1200|I'm in!
1201|Thank you so much for the support.
1202|TK, the third big super check!
1203|Thank you so much!
1204|Huh?
1205|Aww, thank you, TK.
1206|So sweet!
1207|I see another one here, but TK, again.
1208|Here, look, he's always so fun.
1209|Game streams, always entertaining.
1210|Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,
1211|but his stream is so comfy,
1212|and video stream projects always spark excitement.
1213|Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!
1214|Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1215|So sweet!
1216|Thank you so much!
1217|I really appreciate it.
1218|I'm glad, uh, you know,
1219|at the end of the day,
1220|if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,
1221|I'm happy, so thank you.
1222|And Majin D, thank you!
1223|Majin 8, thank you!
1224|I'll see you in the bar!
1225|Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,
1226|I hope you get there safe.
1227|I hope you win the lottery one day for the...
1228|not just the regular lottery,
1229|the main green lottery, I guess.
1230|Uh, right here!
1231|Thank you!
1232|Endless Ame!
1233|Only around Halloween.
1234|Rock the guest box!
1235|Ame, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee!
1236|Uh, Roger Liao, thank you!
1237|Ame, ame, ame, ame, ame!
1238|A12 Flames.
1239|Thank you!
1240|Oh!
1241|Oh, the deep skies nuts!
1242|Yeah, that was a tweet that I read during the panel.
1243|Thank you for the question!
1244|Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1245|Oh my god, this song is really loud.
1246|Okay.
1247|Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.
1248|Uh, where was I?
1249|Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1250|Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.
1251|Uh-huh.
1252|Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!
1253|Oh!
1254|Uh, thank you so much!
1255|Thank you!
1256|I hope you also have a yummy food!
1257|Mm-hmm!
1258|Thank you so much for all the support.
1259|I appreciate it.
1260|Nagi!
1261|Oh, thank you!
1262|Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!
1263|Oh, it was really sweet!
1264|Thank you so much!
1265|Nagi's so cute!
1266|So cute!
1267|Yeah, we got some pictures together.
1268|Thank you, thank you for all your support.
1269|I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.
1270|Thank you!
1271|So many cute teammates!
1272|Thank you!
1273|Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.
1274|Did I have any input for the figure?
1275|Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,
1276|but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.
1277|I think it was for that one.
1278|Mm-hmm.
1279|Aaron Pampo, thank you!
1280|Happy birthday!
1281|This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.
1282|Ooh, an amé party!
1283|Dang, amé cake!
1284|Amé day!
1285|No, just kidding.
1286|I hope the cake was tasty.
1287|I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.
1288|Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!
1289|I hope you have a good rest of the day.
1290|Night!
1291|Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?
1292|Amé cake?
1293|Mm-hmm, amé party!
1294|Very cool.
1295|A flag armor, thank you!
1296|I'll be out of blackberries!
1297|No, no, they're still on the...
1298|They left them on the counter, they're still there!
1299|Eduardo, thank you!
1300|Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.
1301|Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?
1302|Did I say that?
1303|Oh...
1304|I don't remember.
1305|Uh...
1306|Yes, just assume that...
1307|Yes, uh-huh.
1308|I could be at 9-9, thank you!
1309|Um, many times, thank you!
1310|Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,
1311|because, you know, the people around you,
1312|if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,
1313|but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,
1314|at least have heard of it.
1315|Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,
1316|so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.
1317|Mm-hmm!
1318|Xinyoung-ho!
1319|Thank you!
1320|Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!
1321|Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,
1322|aim for 22 games in 2022?
1323|How many do I need left?
1324|How many left are there that I need to complete?
1325|I think it's possible, what?
1326|How many months?
1327|We still have 5 months.
1328|I think it's possible.
1329|20 more to go! 19?
1330|Well, I have some shorter games.
1331|Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,
1332|that I think we could do.
1333|But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,
1334|and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,
1335|Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.
1336|I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.
1337|And I know, um,
1338|there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,
1339|but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,
1340|and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,
1341|and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,
1342|like a platform or something, like a 2D.
1343|Ooh, I did want to play, um...
1344|Hey!
1345|What was that one game?
1346|I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.
1347|Uh...
1348|Crash Bandicoot!
1349|Yeah, I'm gonna play.
1350|Stray? I don't know, it looks...
1351|It looks cute, but I don't know.
1352|Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
1353|Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...
1354|Switch?
1355|Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,
1356|I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,
1357|it seems like a game that would take me a while.
1358|Uh...
1359|It is?
1360|Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?
1361|We'll see.
1362|Uh, Multi, thank you.
1363|Aww...
1364|Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.
1365|Mm-hmm.
1366|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1367|Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity
1368|to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.
1369|Mm-hmm.
1370|Anyways, thank you.
1371|Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.
1372|I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.
1373|Have a snack.
1374|Maybe I'll make a sandwich.
1375|Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.
1376|Um, what do you mean, what?
1377|Huh?
1378|Go to start, thank you.
1379|Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.
1380|Agent Quirobo, thank you.
1381|Gracias.
1382|Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.
1383|Would there be a post for the schedule this week?
1384|Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.
1385|I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.
1386|Mm-hmm.
1387|I think I will post something.
1388|I don't know yet.
1389|If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,
1390|like 24 hours before.
1391|Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.
1392|Mm-hmm.
1393|Semen 2016, oh, thank you.
1394|I hope you're having a good day too.
1395|Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed
1396|the Eurotruck sim stream.
1397|You mean?
1398|Yasami-ka!
1399|Thank you.
1400|Antipi, thank you.
1401|Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays
1402|might be a good way to help fill out the week.
1403|Possibly.
1404|That is true.
1405|Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.
1406|I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.
1407|I keep forgetting.
1408|Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.
1409|It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams
1410|that I've done on there, and I will upload them there
1411|for archive reasons.
1412|Archival, is that a word?
1413|Uh...
1414|Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?
1415|No, Bart, thank you.
1416|Where's Super Chat?
1417|Sorry, we do pops here.
1418|I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it
1419|like a, say something bad or something.
1420|Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.
1421|Twitch sucks!
1422|Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective
1423|good to stream every now and then.
1424|Okay, like imagine this.
1425|Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,
1426|and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.
1427|Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.
1428|Now, of course there's discoverability,
1429|you know, possible within YouTube,
1430|and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,
1431|our whole audience is on YouTube.
1432|But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,
1433|a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,
1434|okay, you could have one person
1435|streaming their perspective on Twitch,
1436|and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.
1437|That's business, baby!
1438|But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming
1439|like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,
1440|it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,
1441|I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.
1442|I don't know.
1443|Maybe it's just all in my head.
1444|I gotta check the statistics.
1445|Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.
1446|How about that?
1447|What was the other one?
1448|Video motion.
1449|Thank you.
1450|Thank you.
1451|Oh, gracias.
1452|The motherfucking workers, thank you.
1453|Nanji Misa, arigato.
1454|Ame-chan, kawaii.
1455|Thank you.
1456|Arigato.
1457|Shadowfire, thank you.
1458|Oh, muchas gracias.
1459|Nice.
1460|Ellen Saputro.
1461|Thank you.
1462|Oh, Arowanas.
1463|Yeah, they look cool.
1464|I like them when they're small, when they're babies,
1465|but Arowana is a type of fish.
1466|They get big.
1467|They get really big, and they'll bite you,
1468|and you can bleed and stuff.
1469|It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank
1470|for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.
1471|Boi-boo, boi-boo.
1472|They're so cute when they're small,
1473|because their eyes are really big.
1474|Let me see if I can show a picture.
1475|Whoa, what is this?
1476|They have this sack.
1477|A weird sack.
1478|What is this weird sack that they have?
1479|I'll show you this picture.
1480|Oh, see, they're so cute.
1481|Yeah, they're expensive.
1482|See, they have this little weird sack.
1483|Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?
1484|Because it looks like only the babies have them.
1485|What is that?
1486|They're born with it?
1487|A digestion sack?
1488|Yeah, they get really big, though.
1489|Let's see, fully grown.
1490|Here.
1491|Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.
1492|This is good for perspective.
1493|I don't know who that is,
1494|but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.
1495|Wait, this looks like Photoshop.
1496|No, it's not real.
1497|It's a clickbait image.
1498|They're not that big.
1499|Let's see if I can find a better picture.
1500|Okay, this is a good one.
1501|Bim, bam, bim, bam.
1502|Oh, my God.
1503|Okay.
1504|Okay.
1505|Yeah.
1506|Yeah, they're cute.
1507|Cute, cute.
1508|Omega hot dog.
1509|Thank you.
1510|What do you call an omega that makes gluten-filled bread?
1511|A Watsonburg dishes baking bed.
1512|Ha, ha.
1513|Very funny.
1514|Oh, Julia, thank you.
1515|What?
1516|Halfway.
1517|Thank you.
1518|You done?
1519|Thank you.
1520|I saw a small omelet at this event.
1521|I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.
1522|Yago was also there.
1523|Didn't do anything to him, right?
1524|Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?
1525|Or since earlier today?
1526|Suss.
1527|Suss.
1528|Maka, thank you.
1529|This is a big super chat.
1530|If you don't remember backstaters,
1531|don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.
1532|Let me see.
1533|Grindings like neon white.
1534|Hmm?
1535|Yeah, we'll see.
1536|I just feel like for people watching,
1537|maybe it's like repetitive or something.
1538|I do think it is pretty fun, though.
1539|I don't really mind backstating neon white
1540|because I don't even look at chat

1577|Always.
1578|AirW1, thank you.
1579|Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?
1580|Three fish got battered.
1581|Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?
1582|Oh, I like that one.
1583|That's a good one.
1584|Okay, P-back.
1585|I see.
1586|I see.
1587|Okay.
1588|Hi, Gavin Dorff.
1589|Thank you.
1590|I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.
1591|What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?
1592|I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.
1593|Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.
1594|Something like that?
1595|Oh, what are they called?
1596|Dragon?
1597|Dragon days?
1598|No.
1599|Sea dragons.
1600|Yeah, sea dragons.
1601|And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.
1602|Pipefish, I think?
1603|They're so cute.
1604|Oh, garden eels.
1605|Yeah, I like seeing those types.
1606|Seahorses especially.
1607|You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater
1608|person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses
1609|had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses
1610|in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they
1611|give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue
1612|inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the
1613|tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.
1614|It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.
1615|So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the
1616|seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like
1617|where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels
1618|so that the seahorse can swim normally again.
1619|So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary
1620|to do.
1621|And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.
1622|Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.
1623|Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they
1624|like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like
1625|a build up of gas.
1626|Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.
1627|Mm-hmm.
1628|It's scary.
1629|What does that happen to us?
1630|Maybe it does.
1631|All right.
1632|Hello, thank you.
1633|Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.
1634|Yeah, thank you.

1689|A red arrow one now.
1690|All right, let's show the class.
1691|Red arrow one now.
1692|Oh, this looks like a fish who could catch an animal crossing.
1693|Oh, I forgot this image was up here.
1694|Mmm, pretty.
1695|It looks like a big betta fish.
1696|Yeah, very bright colored.
1697|Cute.
1698|They're chunky.
1699|Very chunky.
1700|This is a caption on this one.
1701|It's transporting a rare arrow one.
1702|You can see how big it is compared to the arms.
1703|Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.
1704|300 or more.
1705|Hot Cheeto fish.
1706|Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.
1707|Okay, stamps.
1708|This is the last Super Chat.
1709|Don't send it anymore.
1710|If you do, just know that I'm not going to read it.
1711|This is the last Super Chat.
1712|Can I say, thanks so much.
1713|I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,
1714|even though they're not as long as they used to be,
1715|but we get a nice condensed version.
1716|And we have time for other stuff later.

1723|I'll make it back.
1724|Wait, should I get Cities Skyline Deluxe Edition?
1725|Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.
1726|And Harbor means $10 more.
1727|Get the Deluxe.
1728|All right.
1729|Fine.
1730|All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream
1731|because I'm paranoid.
1732|Okay, it's in the cards, though.
1733|All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?
1734|Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.
1735|Oh, my God.
1736|Swimsuit wallpaper.
1737|I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,
1738|which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.
1739|But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.
1740|Oh, no, I'm a doko.
1741|Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.
1742|Yeah, that went well, right?
1743|Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.

32|It looks
33|somewhat normal, okay
34|My immersion, oh no, oh you'll live you'll live
35|Oh
36|Man I was gonna bring berries
37|I was gonna bring berries to the stream. I had blackberries and I left them in the kitchen
38|Well, I get them later. Yes, uh, Baba is already on although there's no song requests open
39|I'm gonna open up the song cue now
40|Give me one a moment
41|How can you add songs great question
42|well
43|you would do exclamation point SR which stands for song request and then put the link of the song you would like to request in
44|in the chat of Bubba, but
45|Which I don't remember the
46|Command is it working? Oh
47|Hold on, let me check something really quick one sec
48|You
49|Okay, now Bubba about his playing can you guys hear it sorry I had to hold on
50|Okay
51|Okay, yeah, it's loud okay, I'll turn down a little bit
52|Okay, turn it down is that better
53|You can hear now, okay cool. So yeah, the key is already open and it fills up really fast because you guys are like
54|robots
55|Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm
56|Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know
57|I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm
58|Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream
59|But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed
60|And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out
61|So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub
62|It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower
63|Mm-hmm
64|Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle
65|So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably
66|I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover
67|Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins
68|They're pretty good. I think I
69|Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I
70|Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead
71|Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a
72|It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you
73|Where is it, um
74|Let's see
75|Okay
76|Weird hold on let me cut there for a second
77|Oh
78|Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?
79|Disappeared
80|The office is gone
81|Doesn't make any sense
82|Don't make no sense. Wait
83|There's that
84|It's probably just like an OBS problem
85|Oh
86|What if I duplicate
87|All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh
88|Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here
89|Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office
90|I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect
91|We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh
92|And it's like it looks 3d
93|Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else

104|Is it just a really quiet song is there just like a minute of silence at the end of a song or something
105|It stopped it broke
106|But it only lets me play this one song. Well, then let me reload it really quick
107|Okay, hopefully that fixed it. Yeah, I guess it has to be this way. Very funny. Very funny. Yeah
108|Shoot
109|I'm trying to hide this misaligned pillow. Oh, what is this? Maybe if I

119|Oh
120|Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you
121|Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank
122|Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about
123|Oh
124|You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs
125|I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to
126|Just to like go outside and talk
127|with person at the store
128|But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream
129|I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I
130|Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just
131|Not healthy for my tummy. Oh
132|What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule
133|Oh
134|Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up
135|For the next
136|The next coming this coming week, let's see
137|I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was
138|Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday
139|Wait, yes, it was a Monday
140|No
141|It was on Tuesday
142|Okay, okay
143|Sorry, sorry
144|Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule
145|sort of
146|Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring
147|starting at AMT time and
148|Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think
149|So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier
150|So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week
151|Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet
152|If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream
153|I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream
154|So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know
155|I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and
156|Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring
157|I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark
158|So I'm not sure
159|If it's gonna be on that day
160|But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh
161|Then on Friday
162|What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one
163|Keep having to refresh it every time
164|Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now
165|I
166|I
167|I
168|Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something
169|That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing
170|All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday
171|We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again
172|Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some
173|Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it
174|Is that like a bird an alarm
175|Alright super chats from
176|Five days ago got it. Oh
177|But before we read super chat, she's gonna see look look look wait
178|Oh
179|Look at this wait, it's too big
180|Hold on oh
181|It's gone and disappeared what the heck
182|Oh
183|It's gone oh
184|Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today
185|Look at the starfish
186|Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank
187|But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it
188|Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose
189|to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so
190|Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass
191|It's cute, right?
192|You can see the mouth in the center there
193|Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy
194|Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the
195|You know the land
196|The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to
197|Yeah, both it's both weird
198|Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small
199|so small and then also
200|Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small
201|This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought
202|It's um
203|Can I use the point?
204|It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer
205|like a little cursor to drag around the screen
206|Alright, I'll point with
207|This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone
208|I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and
209|the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and
210|Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?
211|it's
212|Okay, the video was unavailable
213|Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned
214|I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh
215|Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is
216|It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning
217|They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab
218|Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting
219|things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and
220|In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone
221|So they have like a really cute relationship
222|Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them
223|Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm
224|Now you could see it
225|It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything
226|This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too
227|Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it
228|Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color
229|Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it
230|But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm
231|So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know
232|I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing
233|So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and
234|Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm
235|But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it
236|I want to protect it
237|Yeah, this a anemone
238|It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute
239|They're so cute. And then
240|And then let me see, hold on
241|Hold on
242|Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in
243|Okay, now I will show you guys
244|The frog
245|After I change something really quick
246|Um
247|This one
248|Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm
249|You frog
250|Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up
251|All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels
252|There's one of the frogs
253|Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um
254|He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water
255|They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air
256|And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air
257|Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together
258|But let me see
259|No, this is the only picture I have actually
260|Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again
261|Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them
262|Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny
263|Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out
264|Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space
265|Yeah, we'll see
266|Look at them. I need to zoom in
267|Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them
268|But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams
269|Seems cute
270|What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets
271|They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face
272|They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning
273|And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing
274|So it was getting a mouthful of sand
275|Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it
276|No, they don't usually bother shrimp
277|Not that I've seen anyway
278|I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth
279|But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything
280|I
281|Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys
282|Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted
283|But it doesn't look like we have too much to go

305|I'm not that good at FPS games. I think I have my moments in like FPS games
306|But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good
307|I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well
308|Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates
309|They start messing around in the game
310|Yeah, it's it's well
311|It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to

339|Well, the thing is yes as you should turn you should turn back on the screen when playing apex as you're about to land
340|So then nobody can follow you but it's difficult because if I'm the jump master
341|I have to be tapped into the game to
342|Well, I could put it on a hotkey
343|Yeah, I could put it on a hockey like uh, I
344|Guess it would be like this. Hold on. Let me see I can show you guys a demonstration if you will
345|Like that it would be just like that. Yeah, I'll put it on a hockey. That's a good idea. Thanks. I'm it

352|I don't really have cravings for chips
353|Yeah
354|It's a lessons. Thank you
355|And new a sign I got dog
356|Can you stay I was a thank you. I shoot a sucky. Thank you gentlemen
357|Thank you. Oh, yeah, I learned something today
358|Well, it was like while I was reading
359|researching some stuff
360|Apparently if you guys look at your nails right now
361|Do you guys have like a little white half moon at the bottom part of your nail where it like connects to your finger?
362|Do you guys have that check check?
363|everybody check
364|Yes, yes, yep, nope. No. Yes. Yes
365|Yeah, it's called the wait. I forget what it's called Luna lei. I think Luna lei
366|Uh-huh. Yeah, it means yet. It means if you're missing it, it might mean that you have
367|issues with like nutrition or vitamins
368|Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name
369|Yeah, it's called a Luna lei
370|Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and
371|And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions
372|It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways
373|But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something
374|That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I
375|Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe
376|Oh
377|That's good, maybe my I guess my feet are healthier
378|Yeah, yeah looking at look up it's like when you can tell what color it's like the color of stuff that comes out of your
379|Body indicates, you know like things in your body, right?
380|Yeah, I'm all nervous from lack of I'm a
381|Okay, okay. Oh, yeah, I like this song nice. Okay. Oh, where was I reading super chats back to super chats?
382|Pick a right thing here. Oh, that would be cool. I need toe. Thank you. It is named on sites with fuse old for six times
383|zoom, oh
384|I want to play more fuse
385|Is the season starting again soon on apex? Maybe I'll give it the good old try
386|I'll try hard
387|We'll see I
388|Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it
389|It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch
390|It takes less time. Well, I don't know
391|I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex
392|Maybe it's not that much time
393|But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die
394|Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though
395|Hmm
396|Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something
397|Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob
398|Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh
399|Okay
400|Sorry, I have this like leftover
401|Skin bubble from a blister. I just felt that you

670|and it was, well, they have extras now, I guess.
671|I mean, it's still mine, it's so, you know,
672|I just like supported them, I guess.
673|I just never got the item.
674|Ah, ah, ah.
675|Magic, magic.
676|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
677|Oh, is this a sign, you guys want me to sing this song
678|for karaoke?
679|Magic.
680|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
681|It's magic, magic.
682|I can't read, it's too small.
683|All I have to do is think of you
684|to make the music start to play.
685|Then I dance from down the street and I'm, I can't read.
686|Hey, hey, hey, magic ways.
687|Ooh, you love the girl with magic ways.
688|And it's true.
689|Oh, I can't read, it's too small.
690|The text is too small, I'm struggling here.
691|Okay.
692|Night and night and oh, sweet magic ways.
693|Oh, where was I?
694|Oh, Ricardo, thank you.
695|Oh, Reginald, thank you.
696|Oh, I want to translate this one.
697|Magic, magic.
698|Thank you, thank you, thank you profile, so cute.
699|Must be my new YouTube, I want to say Yo YouTube.
700|My new YouTube profile picture, thank you.
701|I think that it was the, well,
702|I was just like looking through Pixel
703|and I was trying so many different pictures
704|and like it's just that, you know,
705|having blonde hair and being super pale,
706|it's kind of hard with contrast,
707|like to find a good image that contrasts properly
708|for like a small profile picture.
709|So I was just Googling my name
710|and looking through the images and I found this one
711|and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images
712|I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.
713|So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.
714|So I decided to keep it.
715|Magic, magic.
716|Oh, right dude, thank you.
717|Yuste, kam samita.
718|I ate Amaz menu at a collaboration cafe yesterday.
719|It was really good.
720|Hope there'll be more events like this next time.
721|Oh, thank you, kam samita, kam amo yo.
722|Yeah, about the cafe in Korea.
723|And yeah, I saw like what Kyara shared,
724|like some pictures of some very dedicated
725|Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,
726|like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.
727|I think they were camping out like at midnight,
728|waiting for it to open
729|because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.
730|So take some dedication, you know.
731|It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout
732|for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.
733|Yeah, they're very dedicated
734|and they seem really happy too.
735|I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.
736|It'd be awesome.
737|Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,
738|but still.
739|Yeah, that's true.
740|They keep underestimating us.
741|When will they learn?
742|Psycho, thank you.
743|Oh, some coins, thank you.
744|Pick a ring, thank you.
745|Oh yeah, I saw.
746|Was there like for real GTA six announcement?
747|Or was it like a leak or something?
748|I'm ending things, I know.
749|Oh, it's real.
750|They're working on it.
751|Didn't it take like 10 years for GTA five
752|or some like really long amount?
753|Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
754|Cool, I definitely played GTA six
755|when it comes out in four years.
756|Storm blade, thank you.
757|I believe Smulama did isekai some people on that.
758|Faithful day.
759|Storm, oh wait, right next, thank you.
760|YouTube crashed again, thank you.
761|I'm gonna get a close chat.
762|All right.
763|Where was I?
764|Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
765|Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
766|Thank you, the song is distracting.
767|TK, thank you.
768|Can you say I'm saying thank you?
769|Reindeer, thank you.
770|I'm a reed.
771|Thank you, some, oh, attack a goalie, thank you.
772|I almost said Smulama.
773|Yeah, investigators meeting, uh-huh, uh-huh.
774|Thank you for the support.
775|I didn't go, we didn't go, thank you.
776|Are we there yet?
777|I have to use the bathroom.
778|Bubba hit me, it's too hot.
779|Can we get McDonald's over there yet?
780|Shut up.
781|Aw, cute.
782|A new song, arigato.
783|Yejun, thank you.
784|Last time someone drew a picture of Smulama standing outside the big truck
785|fighting a piece of wheat straw,
786|does Smulama want to find someone's mother again?
787|Smulama's got a whole phone book,
788|whole of, uh, you know,
789|you know, uh, victims, nah, nah, nah.
790|Friends.
791|Smulama's got a lot of friends.
792|Or to the, thank you.
793|Thank you.
794|Halfwayang, thank you.
795|Yeah, GTA 5, the Europe map DLC.
796|Can I say I'm saying cute?
797|Taro Cube, saying cute.
798|Maybe trucker Smulama's license from the wrong timeline.
799|Yeah, I think so.
800|Yeah, it's not very valid here.
801|Airbumble, thank you.
802|Pickle Rick times two, thank you.
803|Boss music in Eurotrucks.
804|I guess there was as we were parking.
805|We have a day, thank you.
806|I'm glad you enjoyed the stream, thank you.
807|Thank you.
808|Thank you.
809|Yeah, everybody left the factory,
810|the carrot factory as Smulama was trying to deliver.
811|I guess it would be the, I don't know, processing plant maybe.
812|Uh-huh.
813|Damn, you could fit a lot of carrots in like a 22-foot long truck, huh?
814|Like tons and tons of carrots.
815|Whoa.
816|Okay, thank you.
817|This is harder than me landing on a sun station or parking a truck.
818|The sun station took way longer.
819|Mila, what's up, Detective Extraordinaire, thank you.
820|Hey, Solasos, thank you.
821|Wouldn't it be cool if truck sim had a Fallout mod?
822|It sounds very specific.
823|I guess it'd be more believable if Fallout had a truck sim mod.
824|Uh, Amadeus, thank you.
825|Hidezuki, thank you.
826|By color, thank you.
827|Up a creek, thank you.
828|Yeah, I'll just get a real truck and see how it is, how it really is.
829|Uh, Dunlides, thank you.
830|Uh, Slotham, thank you.
831|Nice boat, thank you.
832|Isute, Kamsamita.
833|Wait, is this what it says? Let me double check.
834|Okay, Multi, thank you.
835|Wajaleo, thank you.
836|Twilight, thank you.
837|Fishstar, thank you.
838|Alright, only about 20% left of the superchets, including the ones from the stream.
839|Itchy.
840|Hold on.
841|Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
842|It's a guy's simulator, I like that.
843|Uh, Rekukun, thank you.
844|Um, A screen, thank you.
845|Truckson.
846|Can I say it? So thank you.
847|Thank you for watching.
848|Kamsamita.
849|Kamsamita.
850|Jiho, komawa yo.
851|Mayscreen, thank you.
852|Aw, thank you.
853|Kuristai, thank you.
854|Alright, now superchets from two days ago. What did we do two days ago?
855|Oh, wait, is this from the free chat? Oh, no.
856|Okay, I guess there's some from the free chat and then some from the today stream.
857|Kuristai, thank you.
858|Oh, Rekukun, thank you.
859|I'm at Crunchyroll Expo for the next two days.
860|I'll be the vlogging. Oh, nice.
861|Did I stream? I don't remember.
862|Just in time, thank you.
863|I hope you enjoyed the convention.
864|Oh, karaoke.
865|Rekukun, thank you.
866|Oh, oh, yes.
867|It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,
868|but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,
869|I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,
870|close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert
871|and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short
872|because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.
873|Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?
874|Aw, cool.
875|Yeah, it was really cool.
876|I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,
877|so her voice was not that great.
878|She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,
879|so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,
880|but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,
881|it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?
882|And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.
883|It's so cool.
884|Mm-hmm, so magical.
885|Aw, where was I?
886|Aw, I made me a thank you.
887|How was it to meet some of your fans?
888|I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,
889|so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,
890|well, how was your convention going?
891|Did you see the KFP stand?
892|I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?
893|Did you see the Artist Alley?
894|How many did I meet?
895|I think, I don't know the exact number,
896|but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.
897|I think a little bit more than 20.
898|Aw, okay, good, thank you.
899|I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.
900|Good, it's a bad influence.
901|Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.
902|It was just some guy in the crowd.
903|Ms. Mint, thank you.
904|Yeah, we made a thank you.
905|Can I ask about the coin purse?
906|It's super cute and I want one.
907|I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,
908|like a long time ago.
909|Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.
910|Pickle Rick, thank you.
911|Next meeting greets, yeah.
912|I wouldn't mind doing them as often.
913|This is convention season still right now,
914|but during convention season I don't mind doing it.
915|It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.
916|I think doing the panel was more difficult
917|than doing the meeting greets because,
918|well, usually in the past when we do panels,
919|there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC
920|who deals with handling the crowd
921|and asking questions and things like that
922|and just keeping the flow going for the panel,
923|but because it was up to each of us,
924|Good and I were talking about different ideas
925|that we could do for the panel,
926|and we just didn't come to a conclusion
927|of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.
928|I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,
929|and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.
930|So we had a lot of ideas,
931|but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,
932|like, oh, just, you know, questions.
933|MeTuber support, okay.
934|It was easy.
935|And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,
936|so I really wanted to, you know,
937|work with that too and do a little musical thing.
938|Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.
939|I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.
940|If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.
941|If I could even get that effect in OBS,
942|which it kind of worked.
943|I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.
944|I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.
945|But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll
946|if we could hand out.
947|I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.
948|If we could hand out like blue and red,
949|those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,
950|something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.
951|I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.
952|You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.
953|But I think it was too last minute anyways.
954|Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.
955|I don't even know how that would be possible.
956|I know you can rent 3D glasses.
957|You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,
958|but those work differently.
959|It's like it takes...
960|Hmm.
961|I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.
962|It like polarizes light circularly.
963|And so what it is, is like when you're watching
964|one of those 3D movies in theaters,
965|is they have like two projectors going,
966|or one that switches really fast back and forth,
967|and they're polarized.
968|Circularly polarized in opposite directions,
969|and each lens only allows one directional,
970|one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.
971|I think I get it.
972|Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.
973|Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.
974|Unless we had a special projector.
975|It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.
976|How do they work?
977|Um...
978|Okay, yeah, light wave physics.
979|It was interesting watching.
980|I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,
981|but this is like pretty complicated.
982|They like talking about, you know, the light waves
983|and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.
984|And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.
985|I don't even think I took a physics class.
986|Oh, no.
987|I kind of took a physics class, yeah.
988|Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.
989|Two YouTube tutorials later.
990|How do magnets work?
991|I don't know, how do they work?
992|It's magic.
993|Um...
994|Let's see.
995|Where was I?
996|Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.
997|Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,
998|I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,
999|I guess it sort of implied there might be something else
1000|coming up soon, so I don't know.
1001|I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,
1002|it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,
1003|but I'm not sure yet.
1004|Uh, no confirmations yet.
1005|Uh, Vercatos, thank you.
1006|Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.
1007|My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember
1008|some of the anime that I really liked.
1009|So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked
1010|and that I remembered that I liked,
1011|but I think there's some anime that I really liked too
1012|that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.
1013|Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?
1014|Congratulations!
1015|A marriage, whoa!
1016|Nice, thank you for the support.
1017|I hope they have a successful marriage.
1018|Marriage.
1019|SS109, thank you.
1020|Picoric, thank you.
1021|Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?
1022|Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.
1023|It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.
1024|Um...
1025|Amidoko kamsamita!
1026|Ah, come on way up.
1027|Fates, thank you.
1028|Yo, yo, yo.
1029|I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.
1030|Amazing sand, thank you.
1031|Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing
1032|for next year's Crunchyroll convention,
1033|but it did seem like a lot of fun,
1034|especially I just tweeted something before the stream.
1035|Everybody's like, ame, ame.
1036|And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.
1037|A small ame was there dancing.
1038|Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.
1039|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1040|It doesn't have to be, you know,
1041|only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.
1042|Um...
1043|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1044|Super Sunday time.
1045|Stratus fight, thank you.
1046|Immediates, thank you.
1047|Bus, thank you.
1048|You can get a degree at the panel the other day.
1049|Thanks so well.
1050|How different was it singing
1051|and being able to watch the crowd?
1052|Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...
1053|Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,
1054|I wasn't watching the crowd
1055|because I was looking at the lyrics.
1056|But, um, yeah, like I said,
1057|watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.
1058|Mm-hmm.
1059|And Smart Boy, thank you.
1060|Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.
1061|Puru put it in at this point.
1062|But you just don't know.
1063|I just wanted to make sure I got it right.
1064|Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.
1065|That'd be cool.
1066|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1067|Tried making amine last night.
1068|It tasted pretty good.
1069|Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.
1070|I'm glad you liked it.
1071|Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.
1072|Aww.
1073|Oh, thank you.
1074|Thank you for the question.
1075|I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.
1076|I-R-L.
1077|Mm-hmm.
1078|Yeah, I'm done.
1079|Mm-hmm.
1080|Yesterday, I got something to do.
1081|This song sounds...
1082|This song sounds kind of sad.
1083|But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.
1084|Alpha 9 5 7 1.
1085|Ooh.
1086|Cool.
1087|Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.
1088|Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.
1089|Thank you.
1090|Thank you.
1091|Thank you.
1092|Aww, thank you.
1093|I'm glad you enjoyed.
1094|Wait.
1095|Thank you.
1096|I'll see you laughing.
1097|Thank you.
1098|Ask Pei.
1099|Thank you.
1100|Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?
1101|Maybe, perhaps?
1102|Uh, I think it's an affiliate.
1103|I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.
1104|Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.
1105|So, I'll, uh, get started on that.
1106|Mm-hmm.
1107|Ifmefa, thank you.
1108|Oh.
1109|Aww, thank you.
1110|Aww, thank you.
1111|Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.
1112|Esta ludos desde Chile.
1113|Oh, Chile.
1114|Very chill.
1115|Muchas gracias.
1116|Anti-whippy, thank you.
1117|It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.
1118|She even became Ian's old mascot.
1119|You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?
1120|Oh.
1121|Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.
1122|I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.
1123|So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.
1124|You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.
1125|So, yeah.
1126|But, yeah, it is really crazy.
1127|It is surprising.
1128|But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,
1129|and people started using them in memes.
1130|So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.
1131|She's, like, 40 now.
1132|Small Aime is the real idol here.
1133|Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.
1134|What do you guys think?
1135|Oh, there's an idea.
1136|Hey, I can do it on my own.
1137|Well, not all alone, but...
1138|Huh.
1139|All right, well, stay tuned.
1140|Flynn Playmable, thank you.
1141|Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.
1142|TK, thank you.
1143|First, Akka Super Chat.
1144|Oh, that was a solid one.
1145|Thank you so much, TK.
1146|Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.
1147|Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.
1148|Thank you.
1149|At TotoCubes, thank you.
1150|Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?
1151|Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.
1152|Me too.
1153|Last time, 39. Thank you.
1154|The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.
1155|It looks so good.
1156|Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.
1157|Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?
1158|Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...
1159|Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.
1160|Right next, thank you.
1161|Does Mama get put back in the box?
1162|Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.
1163|I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?
1164|At TK, thank you.
1165|Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.
1166|Aw.
1167|Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.
1168|I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.
1169|Thank you, thank you for the support.
1170|Thank you.
1171|Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.
1172|I'm in it all night.
1173|Rock the gas bar. Rock the...
1174|Lock the taskbar.
1175|All right, dear. Thank you.
1176|Yeah.
1177|It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...
1178|You know, I think she's getting better.
1179|I think she's improving a little bit.
1180|Uh, Lynn, thank you.
1181|YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.
1182|There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,
1183|and even has a shark egg.
1184|Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,
1185|fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.
1186|Watch me put them in.
1187|And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,
1188|what's up, fish heads?
1189|And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.
1190|And it's not even that cool when you see it.
1191|I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...
1192|They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,
1193|really high-quality videos of their tanks.
1194|And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,
1195|and there's, like, relaxing music, so...
1196|That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.
1197|Uh, Kram, thank you so much!
1198|Another big substitute!
1199|It just says,
1200|I'm in!
1201|Thank you so much for the support.
1202|TK, the third big super check!
1203|Thank you so much!
1204|Huh?
1205|Aww, thank you, TK.
1206|So sweet!
1207|I see another one here, but TK, again.
1208|Here, look, he's always so fun.
1209|Game streams, always entertaining.
1210|Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,
1211|but his stream is so comfy,
1212|and video stream projects always spark excitement.
1213|Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!
1214|Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1215|So sweet!
1216|Thank you so much!
1217|I really appreciate it.
1218|I'm glad, uh, you know,
1219|at the end of the day,
1220|if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,
1221|I'm happy, so thank you.
1222|And Majin D, thank you!
1223|Majin 8, thank you!
1224|I'll see you in the bar!
1225|Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,
1226|I hope you get there safe.
1227|I hope you win the lottery one day for the...
1228|not just the regular lottery,
1229|the main green lottery, I guess.
1230|Uh, right here!
1231|Thank you!
1232|Endless Ame!

1243|Thank you for the question!
1244|Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1245|Oh my god, this song is really loud.
1246|Okay.
1247|Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.
1248|Uh, where was I?
1249|Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1250|Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.
1251|Uh-huh.
1252|Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!
1253|Oh!
1254|Uh, thank you so much!
1255|Thank you!
1256|I hope you also have a yummy food!
1257|Mm-hmm!
1258|Thank you so much for all the support.
1259|I appreciate it.
1260|Nagi!
1261|Oh, thank you!
1262|Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!
1263|Oh, it was really sweet!
1264|Thank you so much!
1265|Nagi's so cute!
1266|So cute!
1267|Yeah, we got some pictures together.
1268|Thank you, thank you for all your support.
1269|I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.
1270|Thank you!
1271|So many cute teammates!
1272|Thank you!
1273|Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.
1274|Did I have any input for the figure?
1275|Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,
1276|but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.
1277|I think it was for that one.
1278|Mm-hmm.
1279|Aaron Pampo, thank you!
1280|Happy birthday!
1281|This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.
1282|Ooh, an amé party!
1283|Dang, amé cake!
1284|Amé day!
1285|No, just kidding.
1286|I hope the cake was tasty.
1287|I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.
1288|Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!
1289|I hope you have a good rest of the day.
1290|Night!
1291|Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?
1292|Amé cake?
1293|Mm-hmm, amé party!
1294|Very cool.
1295|A flag armor, thank you!
1296|I'll be out of blackberries!
1297|No, no, they're still on the...
1298|They left them on the counter, they're still there!
1299|Eduardo, thank you!
1300|Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.
1301|Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?
1302|Did I say that?
1303|Oh...
1304|I don't remember.
1305|Uh...
1306|Yes, just assume that...
1307|Yes, uh-huh.
1308|I could be at 9-9, thank you!
1309|Um, many times, thank you!
1310|Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,
1311|because, you know, the people around you,
1312|if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,
1313|but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,
1314|at least have heard of it.
1315|Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,
1316|so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.
1317|Mm-hmm!
1318|Xinyoung-ho!
1319|Thank you!
1320|Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!
1321|Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,
1322|aim for 22 games in 2022?
1323|How many do I need left?
1324|How many left are there that I need to complete?
1325|I think it's possible, what?
1326|How many months?
1327|We still have 5 months.
1328|I think it's possible.
1329|20 more to go! 19?
1330|Well, I have some shorter games.
1331|Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,
1332|that I think we could do.
1333|But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,
1334|and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,
1335|Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.
1336|I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.
1337|And I know, um,
1338|there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,
1339|but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,
1340|and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,
1341|and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,
1342|like a platform or something, like a 2D.
1343|Ooh, I did want to play, um...
1344|Hey!
1345|What was that one game?
1346|I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.
1347|Uh...
1348|Crash Bandicoot!
1349|Yeah, I'm gonna play.
1350|Stray? I don't know, it looks...
1351|It looks cute, but I don't know.
1352|Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
1353|Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...
1354|Switch?
1355|Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,
1356|I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,
1357|it seems like a game that would take me a while.
1358|Uh...
1359|It is?
1360|Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?
1361|We'll see.
1362|Uh, Multi, thank you.
1363|Aww...
1364|Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.
1365|Mm-hmm.
1366|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1367|Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity
1368|to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.
1369|Mm-hmm.
1370|Anyways, thank you.
1371|Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.
1372|I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.
1373|Have a snack.
1374|Maybe I'll make a sandwich.
1375|Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.
1376|Um, what do you mean, what?
1377|Huh?
1378|Go to start, thank you.
1379|Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.
1380|Agent Quirobo, thank you.
1381|Gracias.
1382|Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.
1383|Would there be a post for the schedule this week?
1384|Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.
1385|I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.
1386|Mm-hmm.
1387|I think I will post something.
1388|I don't know yet.
1389|If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,
1390|like 24 hours before.
1391|Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.
1392|Mm-hmm.
1393|Semen 2016, oh, thank you.
1394|I hope you're having a good day too.
1395|Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed
1396|the Eurotruck sim stream.
1397|You mean?
1398|Yasami-ka!
1399|Thank you.
1400|Antipi, thank you.
1401|Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays
1402|might be a good way to help fill out the week.
1403|Possibly.
1404|That is true.
1405|Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.
1406|I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.
1407|I keep forgetting.
1408|Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.
1409|It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams
1410|that I've done on there, and I will upload them there
1411|for archive reasons.
1412|Archival, is that a word?
1413|Uh...
1414|Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?
1415|No, Bart, thank you.
1416|Where's Super Chat?
1417|Sorry, we do pops here.
1418|I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it
1419|like a, say something bad or something.
1420|Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.
1421|Twitch sucks!
1422|Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective
1423|good to stream every now and then.
1424|Okay, like imagine this.
1425|Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,
1426|and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.
1427|Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.
1428|Now, of course there's discoverability,
1429|you know, possible within YouTube,
1430|and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,
1431|our whole audience is on YouTube.
1432|But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,
1433|a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,
1434|okay, you could have one person
1435|streaming their perspective on Twitch,
1436|and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.
1437|That's business, baby!
1438|But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming
1439|like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,
1440|it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,
1441|I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.
1442|I don't know.
1443|Maybe it's just all in my head.
1444|I gotta check the statistics.
1445|Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.
1446|How about that?
1447|What was the other one?
1448|Video motion.
1449|Thank you.
1450|Thank you.
1451|Oh, gracias.
1452|The motherfucking workers, thank you.
1453|Nanji Misa, arigato.
1454|Ame-chan, kawaii.
1455|Thank you.
1456|Arigato.
1457|Shadowfire, thank you.
1458|Oh, muchas gracias.
1459|Nice.
1460|Ellen Saputro.
1461|Thank you.
1462|Oh, Arowanas.
1463|Yeah, they look cool.
1464|I like them when they're small, when they're babies,
1465|but Arowana is a type of fish.
1466|They get big.
1467|They get really big, and they'll bite you,
1468|and you can bleed and stuff.
1469|It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank
1470|for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.
1471|Boi-boo, boi-boo.
1472|They're so cute when they're small,
1473|because their eyes are really big.
1474|Let me see if I can show a picture.
1475|Whoa, what is this?
1476|They have this sack.
1477|A weird sack.
1478|What is this weird sack that they have?
1479|I'll show you this picture.
1480|Oh, see, they're so cute.
1481|Yeah, they're expensive.
1482|See, they have this little weird sack.
1483|Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?
1484|Because it looks like only the babies have them.
1485|What is that?
1486|They're born with it?
1487|A digestion sack?
1488|Yeah, they get really big, though.
1489|Let's see, fully grown.
1490|Here.
1491|Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.
1492|This is good for perspective.
1493|I don't know who that is,
1494|but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.
1495|Wait, this looks like Photoshop.
1496|No, it's not real.
1497|It's a clickbait image.
1498|They're not that big.
1499|Let's see if I can find a better picture.
1500|Okay, this is a good one.
1501|Bim, bam, bim, bam.
1502|Oh, my God.
1503|Okay.
1504|Okay.
1505|Yeah.
1506|Yeah, they're cute.
1507|Cute, cute.
1508|Omega hot dog.
1509|Thank you.
1510|What do you call an omega that makes gluten-filled bread?
1511|A Watsonburg dishes baking bed.
1512|Ha, ha.
1513|Very funny.
1514|Oh, Julia, thank you.
1515|What?
1516|Halfway.
1517|Thank you.
1518|You done?
1519|Thank you.
1520|I saw a small omelet at this event.
1521|I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.
1522|Yago was also there.
1523|Didn't do anything to him, right?
1524|Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?
1525|Or since earlier today?
1526|Suss.
1527|Suss.
1528|Maka, thank you.
1529|This is a big super chat.
1530|If you don't remember backstaters,
1531|don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.
1532|Let me see.
1533|Grindings like neon white.
1534|Hmm?
1535|Yeah, we'll see.
1536|I just feel like for people watching,
1537|maybe it's like repetitive or something.
1538|I do think it is pretty fun, though.
1539|I don't really mind backstating neon white
1540|because I don't even look at chat
1541|unless I ask you guys a question.
1542|I'm sorry, boy.
1543|Thank you.
1544|Ryan, Quebec.
1545|Thank you.
1546|That's right.
1547|Investigators.
1548|No bathroom breaks.
1549|Investigator breaks only.
1550|Investigator meetings only.
1551|A look-in.
1552|Thank you.
1553|Huh?
1554|Okay.
1555|Face of motion.
1556|Thank you.
1557|Yeah.
1558|Bubble bot.
1559|MVP.
1560|Oh, what's it, Mila 5?
1561|Oh, 1527.
1562|Oh, thank you.
1563|Yes, I'll pick them up.
1564|Thank you.
1565|Lucky senpai.
1566|Thank you.
1567|Oh, at the meet and greet.
1568|Thank you for stopping by.
1569|Thank you for the super chat.
1570|I appreciate it.
1571|Thank you.
1572|Itsu-mo.
1573|Kamalaya.
1574|Is it itsu-mo?
1575|Is it like it always...
1576|It means like it's always or something?
1577|Always.
1578|AirW1, thank you.
1579|Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?
1580|Three fish got battered.
1581|Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?
1582|Oh, I like that one.
1583|That's a good one.
1584|Okay, P-back.
1585|I see.
1586|I see.
1587|Okay.
1588|Hi, Gavin Dorff.
1589|Thank you.
1590|I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.
1591|What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?
1592|I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.
1593|Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.
1594|Something like that?
1595|Oh, what are they called?
1596|Dragon?
1597|Dragon days?
1598|No.
1599|Sea dragons.
1600|Yeah, sea dragons.
1601|And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.
1602|Pipefish, I think?
1603|They're so cute.
1604|Oh, garden eels.
1605|Yeah, I like seeing those types.
1606|Seahorses especially.
1607|You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater
1608|person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses
1609|had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses
1610|in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they
1611|give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue
1612|inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the
1613|tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.
1614|It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.
1615|So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the
1616|seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like
1617|where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels
1618|so that the seahorse can swim normally again.
1619|So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary
1620|to do.
1621|And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.
1622|Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.
1623|Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they
1624|like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like
1625|a build up of gas.
1626|Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.
1627|Mm-hmm.
1628|It's scary.
1629|What does that happen to us?
1630|Maybe it does.
1631|All right.
1632|Hello, thank you.
1633|Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.
1634|Yeah, thank you.
1635|Happy early international cat day to Wellington Henry.
1636|Oh cute, what is that?
1637|International cat day tomorrow?
1638|There's too many, there's too many of these like weird holidays, internet holidays.
1639|Oh my gosh.
1640|Oh my gosh.
1641|Oh my gosh.
1642|Oh my gosh.
1643|Oh my gosh.
1644|Oh my gosh.
1645|Oh my gosh.
1646|Oh my gosh.
1647|Oh my gosh.
1648|Oh my gosh.
1649|Oh my gosh.
1650|What is that, international cat day tomorrow, there's too many of these like weird holidays,
1651|internet holidays.
1652|I'll make sure to give them a treat though.
1653|Epic work, thank you.

1699|Very chunky.
1700|This is a caption on this one.
1701|It's transporting a rare arrow one.
1702|You can see how big it is compared to the arms.
1703|Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.
1704|300 or more.
1705|Hot Cheeto fish.
1706|Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.
1707|Okay, stamps.

1712|Can I say, thanks so much.
1713|I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,
1714|even though they're not as long as they used to be,

1725|Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.
1726|And Harbor means $10 more.
1727|Get the Deluxe.
1728|All right.
1729|Fine.
1730|All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream
1731|because I'm paranoid.
1732|Okay, it's in the cards, though.
1733|All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?
1734|Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.
1735|Oh, my God.
1736|Swimsuit wallpaper.
1737|I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,
1738|which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.
1739|But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.
1740|Oh, no, I'm a doko.
1741|Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.
1742|Yeah, that went well, right?
1743|Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.

27|This stream is a Sunday. You guys know
28|dedicated to rating super chats
29|Yeah, good to see you guys again. Am I I feel like uh, hold on one second
30|Hi, my head's small, okay, this is better wait, not really
31|That looks normal sort of maybe a little bit bigger
32|It looks
33|somewhat normal, okay
34|My immersion, oh no, oh you'll live you'll live
35|Oh
36|Man I was gonna bring berries
37|I was gonna bring berries to the stream. I had blackberries and I left them in the kitchen
38|Well, I get them later. Yes, uh, Baba is already on although there's no song requests open
39|I'm gonna open up the song cue now
40|Give me one a moment
41|How can you add songs great question
42|well
43|you would do exclamation point SR which stands for song request and then put the link of the song you would like to request in
44|in the chat of Bubba, but
45|Which I don't remember the
46|Command is it working? Oh
47|Hold on, let me check something really quick one sec
48|You
49|Okay, now Bubba about his playing can you guys hear it sorry I had to hold on
50|Okay
51|Okay, yeah, it's loud okay, I'll turn down a little bit
52|Okay, turn it down is that better
53|You can hear now, okay cool. So yeah, the key is already open and it fills up really fast because you guys are like
54|robots
55|Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm
56|Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know
57|I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm
58|Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream
59|But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed
60|And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out
61|So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub
62|It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower
63|Mm-hmm
64|Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle
65|So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably
66|I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover
67|Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins
68|They're pretty good. I think I
69|Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I
70|Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead
71|Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a
72|It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you
73|Where is it, um
74|Let's see
75|Okay
76|Weird hold on let me cut there for a second
77|Oh
78|Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?
79|Disappeared
80|The office is gone
81|Doesn't make any sense
82|Don't make no sense. Wait
83|There's that
84|It's probably just like an OBS problem
85|Oh
86|What if I duplicate
87|All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh
88|Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here
89|Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office
90|I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect
91|We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh
92|And it's like it looks 3d
93|Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else
94|Are you guys doing today on this Sunday? Oh
95|That's better now it doesn't look like I'm reading although my arms look so big
96|Good
97|Does that work

100|That's a little bit better maybe just a tiny bit
101|Wait, is this is this lined up this where is this supposed to be? Oh here looks so high
102|Okay, well what it looks scuff to me wait, okay, I just don't look don't look don't look don't look
103|What happened to Papa but is it playing cuz I don't hear anything
104|Is it just a really quiet song is there just like a minute of silence at the end of a song or something
105|It stopped it broke
106|But it only lets me play this one song. Well, then let me reload it really quick
107|Okay, hopefully that fixed it. Yeah, I guess it has to be this way. Very funny. Very funny. Yeah
108|Shoot
109|I'm trying to hide this misaligned pillow. Oh, what is this? Maybe if I
110|Look the pillow has like a little bite taken out of it. I think it's supposed to go by this armrest, but it don't fit
111|So I'm a lid I won't fit

116|To give thanks for thy super chats
117|Uh
118|Wait, does anybody know where from where I'm reading from super chat's from my head is too big
119|Oh
120|Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you
121|Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank
122|Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about
123|Oh
124|You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs
125|I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to
126|Just to like go outside and talk
127|with person at the store
128|But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream
129|I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I
130|Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just
131|Not healthy for my tummy. Oh
132|What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule
133|Oh
134|Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up
135|For the next
136|The next coming this coming week, let's see
137|I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was
138|Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday
139|Wait, yes, it was a Monday
140|No
141|It was on Tuesday
142|Okay, okay
143|Sorry, sorry
144|Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule
145|sort of
146|Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring
147|starting at AMT time and
148|Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think
149|So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier
150|So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week
151|Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet
152|If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream
153|I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream
154|So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know
155|I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and
156|Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring
157|I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark
158|So I'm not sure
159|If it's gonna be on that day
160|But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh
161|Then on Friday
162|What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one
163|Keep having to refresh it every time
164|Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now
165|I
166|I
167|I
168|Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something
169|That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing
170|All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday
171|We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again
172|Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some
173|Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it
174|Is that like a bird an alarm
175|Alright super chats from
176|Five days ago got it. Oh
177|But before we read super chat, she's gonna see look look look wait
178|Oh
179|Look at this wait, it's too big
180|Hold on oh
181|It's gone and disappeared what the heck
182|Oh
183|It's gone oh
184|Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today
185|Look at the starfish
186|Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank
187|But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it
188|Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose
189|to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so
190|Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass
191|It's cute, right?
192|You can see the mouth in the center there
193|Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy
194|Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the
195|You know the land
196|The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to
197|Yeah, both it's both weird
198|Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small
199|so small and then also
200|Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small
201|This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought
202|It's um
203|Can I use the point?
204|It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer
205|like a little cursor to drag around the screen
206|Alright, I'll point with
207|This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone
208|I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and
209|the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and
210|Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?
211|it's
212|Okay, the video was unavailable
213|Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned
214|I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh
215|Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is
216|It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning
217|They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab
218|Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting
219|things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and
220|In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone
221|So they have like a really cute relationship
222|Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them
223|Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm
224|Now you could see it
225|It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything
226|This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too
227|Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it
228|Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color
229|Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it
230|But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm
231|So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know
232|I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing
233|So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and
234|Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm
235|But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it
236|I want to protect it
237|Yeah, this a anemone
238|It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute
239|They're so cute. And then
240|And then let me see, hold on
241|Hold on
242|Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in
243|Okay, now I will show you guys
244|The frog
245|After I change something really quick
246|Um
247|This one
248|Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm
249|You frog
250|Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up
251|All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels
252|There's one of the frogs
253|Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um
254|He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water
255|They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air
256|And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air
257|Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together
258|But let me see
259|No, this is the only picture I have actually
260|Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again
261|Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them
262|Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny
263|Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out
264|Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space
265|Yeah, we'll see
266|Look at them. I need to zoom in
267|Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them
268|But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams
269|Seems cute
270|What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets
271|They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face
272|They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning
273|And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing
274|So it was getting a mouthful of sand
275|Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it
276|No, they don't usually bother shrimp
277|Not that I've seen anyway
278|I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth
279|But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything
280|I
281|Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys
282|Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted
283|But it doesn't look like we have too much to go
284|I didn't have to scroll too much to get down to these super chats now reading from the apex collab with a mume

305|I'm not that good at FPS games. I think I have my moments in like FPS games
306|But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good
307|I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well
308|Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates
309|They start messing around in the game
310|Yeah, it's it's well
311|It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to

356|Can you stay I was a thank you. I shoot a sucky. Thank you gentlemen
357|Thank you. Oh, yeah, I learned something today
358|Well, it was like while I was reading
359|researching some stuff
360|Apparently if you guys look at your nails right now
361|Do you guys have like a little white half moon at the bottom part of your nail where it like connects to your finger?
362|Do you guys have that check check?
363|everybody check
364|Yes, yes, yep, nope. No. Yes. Yes
365|Yeah, it's called the wait. I forget what it's called Luna lei. I think Luna lei
366|Uh-huh. Yeah, it means yet. It means if you're missing it, it might mean that you have
367|issues with like nutrition or vitamins
368|Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name
369|Yeah, it's called a Luna lei
370|Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and
371|And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions
372|It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways
373|But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something
374|That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I
375|Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe

386|I'll try hard
387|We'll see I
388|Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it
389|It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch
390|It takes less time. Well, I don't know
391|I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex
392|Maybe it's not that much time
393|But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die
394|Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though
395|Hmm
396|Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something
397|Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob
398|Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh

699|Must be my new YouTube, I want to say Yo YouTube.
700|My new YouTube profile picture, thank you.
701|I think that it was the, well,
702|I was just like looking through Pixel
703|and I was trying so many different pictures
704|and like it's just that, you know,
705|having blonde hair and being super pale,
706|it's kind of hard with contrast,
707|like to find a good image that contrasts properly
708|for like a small profile picture.
709|So I was just Googling my name
710|and looking through the images and I found this one
711|and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images
712|I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.
713|So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.
714|So I decided to keep it.
715|Magic, magic.
716|Oh, right dude, thank you.
717|Yuste, kam samita.

724|like some pictures of some very dedicated
725|Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,
726|like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.
727|I think they were camping out like at midnight,
728|waiting for it to open
729|because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.
730|So take some dedication, you know.
731|It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout
732|for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.
733|Yeah, they're very dedicated
734|and they seem really happy too.
735|I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.
736|It'd be awesome.
737|Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,
738|but still.
739|Yeah, that's true.

783|Yejun, thank you.
784|Last time someone drew a picture of Smulama standing outside the big truck
785|fighting a piece of wheat straw,
786|does Smulama want to find someone's mother again?
787|Smulama's got a whole phone book,
788|whole of, uh, you know,
789|you know, uh, victims, nah, nah, nah.
790|Friends.
791|Smulama's got a lot of friends.
792|Or to the, thank you.
793|Thank you.
794|Halfwayang, thank you.
795|Yeah, GTA 5, the Europe map DLC.
796|Can I say I'm saying cute?
797|Taro Cube, saying cute.
798|Maybe trucker Smulama's license from the wrong timeline.
799|Yeah, I think so.
800|Yeah, it's not very valid here.
801|Airbumble, thank you.
802|Pickle Rick times two, thank you.
803|Boss music in Eurotrucks.
804|I guess there was as we were parking.
805|We have a day, thank you.
806|I'm glad you enjoyed the stream, thank you.
807|Thank you.
808|Thank you.
809|Yeah, everybody left the factory,
810|the carrot factory as Smulama was trying to deliver.
811|I guess it would be the, I don't know, processing plant maybe.
812|Uh-huh.
813|Damn, you could fit a lot of carrots in like a 22-foot long truck, huh?
814|Like tons and tons of carrots.
815|Whoa.
816|Okay, thank you.
817|This is harder than me landing on a sun station or parking a truck.
818|The sun station took way longer.
819|Mila, what's up, Detective Extraordinaire, thank you.
820|Hey, Solasos, thank you.
821|Wouldn't it be cool if truck sim had a Fallout mod?
822|It sounds very specific.
823|I guess it'd be more believable if Fallout had a truck sim mod.
824|Uh, Amadeus, thank you.
825|Hidezuki, thank you.
826|By color, thank you.
827|Up a creek, thank you.
828|Yeah, I'll just get a real truck and see how it is, how it really is.
829|Uh, Dunlides, thank you.
830|Uh, Slotham, thank you.
831|Nice boat, thank you.
832|Isute, Kamsamita.
833|Wait, is this what it says? Let me double check.
834|Okay, Multi, thank you.
835|Wajaleo, thank you.
836|Twilight, thank you.
837|Fishstar, thank you.
838|Alright, only about 20% left of the superchets, including the ones from the stream.
839|Itchy.
840|Hold on.
841|Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
842|It's a guy's simulator, I like that.
843|Uh, Rekukun, thank you.
844|Um, A screen, thank you.
845|Truckson.
846|Can I say it? So thank you.
847|Thank you for watching.
848|Kamsamita.
849|Kamsamita.
850|Jiho, komawa yo.
851|Mayscreen, thank you.
852|Aw, thank you.
853|Kuristai, thank you.
854|Alright, now superchets from two days ago. What did we do two days ago?
855|Oh, wait, is this from the free chat? Oh, no.
856|Okay, I guess there's some from the free chat and then some from the today stream.
857|Kuristai, thank you.
858|Oh, Rekukun, thank you.
859|I'm at Crunchyroll Expo for the next two days.
860|I'll be the vlogging. Oh, nice.
861|Did I stream? I don't remember.
862|Just in time, thank you.
863|I hope you enjoyed the convention.
864|Oh, karaoke.
865|Rekukun, thank you.
866|Oh, oh, yes.
867|It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,
868|but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,
869|I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,
870|close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert
871|and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short
872|because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.
873|Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?
874|Aw, cool.
875|Yeah, it was really cool.
876|I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,
877|so her voice was not that great.
878|She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,
879|so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,
880|but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,
881|it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?
882|And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.
883|It's so cool.
884|Mm-hmm, so magical.
885|Aw, where was I?
886|Aw, I made me a thank you.
887|How was it to meet some of your fans?
888|I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,
889|so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,
890|well, how was your convention going?
891|Did you see the KFP stand?
892|I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?
893|Did you see the Artist Alley?
894|How many did I meet?
895|I think, I don't know the exact number,
896|but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.
897|I think a little bit more than 20.
898|Aw, okay, good, thank you.
899|I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.
900|Good, it's a bad influence.
901|Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.
902|It was just some guy in the crowd.
903|Ms. Mint, thank you.
904|Yeah, we made a thank you.
905|Can I ask about the coin purse?
906|It's super cute and I want one.
907|I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,
908|like a long time ago.
909|Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.
910|Pickle Rick, thank you.
911|Next meeting greets, yeah.
912|I wouldn't mind doing them as often.
913|This is convention season still right now,
914|but during convention season I don't mind doing it.
915|It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.
916|I think doing the panel was more difficult
917|than doing the meeting greets because,
918|well, usually in the past when we do panels,
919|there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC
920|who deals with handling the crowd
921|and asking questions and things like that
922|and just keeping the flow going for the panel,
923|but because it was up to each of us,
924|Good and I were talking about different ideas
925|that we could do for the panel,
926|and we just didn't come to a conclusion
927|of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.
928|I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,
929|and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.
930|So we had a lot of ideas,
931|but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,
932|like, oh, just, you know, questions.
933|MeTuber support, okay.
934|It was easy.
935|And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,
936|so I really wanted to, you know,
937|work with that too and do a little musical thing.
938|Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.
939|I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.
940|If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.
941|If I could even get that effect in OBS,
942|which it kind of worked.
943|I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.
944|I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.
945|But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll
946|if we could hand out.
947|I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.
948|If we could hand out like blue and red,
949|those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,
950|something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.
951|I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.
952|You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.
953|But I think it was too last minute anyways.
954|Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.
955|I don't even know how that would be possible.
956|I know you can rent 3D glasses.
957|You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,
958|but those work differently.
959|It's like it takes...
960|Hmm.
961|I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.
962|It like polarizes light circularly.
963|And so what it is, is like when you're watching
964|one of those 3D movies in theaters,
965|is they have like two projectors going,
966|or one that switches really fast back and forth,
967|and they're polarized.
968|Circularly polarized in opposite directions,
969|and each lens only allows one directional,
970|one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.
971|I think I get it.
972|Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.
973|Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.
974|Unless we had a special projector.
975|It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.
976|How do they work?
977|Um...
978|Okay, yeah, light wave physics.
979|It was interesting watching.
980|I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,
981|but this is like pretty complicated.
982|They like talking about, you know, the light waves
983|and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.
984|And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.
985|I don't even think I took a physics class.
986|Oh, no.
987|I kind of took a physics class, yeah.
988|Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.
989|Two YouTube tutorials later.
990|How do magnets work?
991|I don't know, how do they work?
992|It's magic.
993|Um...
994|Let's see.
995|Where was I?
996|Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.
997|Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,
998|I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,
999|I guess it sort of implied there might be something else
1000|coming up soon, so I don't know.
1001|I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,
1002|it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,
1003|but I'm not sure yet.
1004|Uh, no confirmations yet.
1005|Uh, Vercatos, thank you.
1006|Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.
1007|My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember
1008|some of the anime that I really liked.
1009|So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked
1010|and that I remembered that I liked,
1011|but I think there's some anime that I really liked too
1012|that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.
1013|Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?
1014|Congratulations!
1015|A marriage, whoa!
1016|Nice, thank you for the support.
1017|I hope they have a successful marriage.
1018|Marriage.
1019|SS109, thank you.
1020|Picoric, thank you.
1021|Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?
1022|Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.
1023|It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.
1024|Um...
1025|Amidoko kamsamita!
1026|Ah, come on way up.
1027|Fates, thank you.
1028|Yo, yo, yo.
1029|I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.
1030|Amazing sand, thank you.
1031|Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing
1032|for next year's Crunchyroll convention,
1033|but it did seem like a lot of fun,
1034|especially I just tweeted something before the stream.
1035|Everybody's like, ame, ame.
1036|And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.
1037|A small ame was there dancing.
1038|Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.
1039|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1040|It doesn't have to be, you know,
1041|only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.
1042|Um...
1043|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1044|Super Sunday time.
1045|Stratus fight, thank you.
1046|Immediates, thank you.
1047|Bus, thank you.
1048|You can get a degree at the panel the other day.
1049|Thanks so well.
1050|How different was it singing
1051|and being able to watch the crowd?
1052|Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...
1053|Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,
1054|I wasn't watching the crowd
1055|because I was looking at the lyrics.
1056|But, um, yeah, like I said,
1057|watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.
1058|Mm-hmm.
1059|And Smart Boy, thank you.
1060|Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.
1061|Puru put it in at this point.
1062|But you just don't know.
1063|I just wanted to make sure I got it right.
1064|Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.
1065|That'd be cool.
1066|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1067|Tried making amine last night.
1068|It tasted pretty good.
1069|Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.
1070|I'm glad you liked it.
1071|Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.
1072|Aww.
1073|Oh, thank you.
1074|Thank you for the question.
1075|I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.
1076|I-R-L.
1077|Mm-hmm.
1078|Yeah, I'm done.
1079|Mm-hmm.
1080|Yesterday, I got something to do.
1081|This song sounds...
1082|This song sounds kind of sad.
1083|But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.
1084|Alpha 9 5 7 1.
1085|Ooh.
1086|Cool.
1087|Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.
1088|Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.
1089|Thank you.
1090|Thank you.
1091|Thank you.
1092|Aww, thank you.
1093|I'm glad you enjoyed.
1094|Wait.
1095|Thank you.
1096|I'll see you laughing.
1097|Thank you.
1098|Ask Pei.
1099|Thank you.
1100|Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?
1101|Maybe, perhaps?
1102|Uh, I think it's an affiliate.
1103|I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.
1104|Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.
1105|So, I'll, uh, get started on that.
1106|Mm-hmm.
1107|Ifmefa, thank you.
1108|Oh.
1109|Aww, thank you.
1110|Aww, thank you.
1111|Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.
1112|Esta ludos desde Chile.
1113|Oh, Chile.
1114|Very chill.
1115|Muchas gracias.
1116|Anti-whippy, thank you.
1117|It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.
1118|She even became Ian's old mascot.
1119|You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?
1120|Oh.
1121|Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.
1122|I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.
1123|So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.
1124|You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.
1125|So, yeah.
1126|But, yeah, it is really crazy.
1127|It is surprising.
1128|But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,
1129|and people started using them in memes.
1130|So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.
1131|She's, like, 40 now.
1132|Small Aime is the real idol here.
1133|Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.
1134|What do you guys think?
1135|Oh, there's an idea.
1136|Hey, I can do it on my own.
1137|Well, not all alone, but...
1138|Huh.
1139|All right, well, stay tuned.
1140|Flynn Playmable, thank you.
1141|Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.
1142|TK, thank you.
1143|First, Akka Super Chat.
1144|Oh, that was a solid one.
1145|Thank you so much, TK.
1146|Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.
1147|Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.
1148|Thank you.
1149|At TotoCubes, thank you.
1150|Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?
1151|Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.
1152|Me too.
1153|Last time, 39. Thank you.
1154|The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.
1155|It looks so good.
1156|Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.
1157|Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?
1158|Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...
1159|Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.
1160|Right next, thank you.
1161|Does Mama get put back in the box?
1162|Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.
1163|I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?
1164|At TK, thank you.
1165|Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.
1166|Aw.
1167|Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.
1168|I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.
1169|Thank you, thank you for the support.
1170|Thank you.
1171|Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.
1172|I'm in it all night.
1173|Rock the gas bar. Rock the...
1174|Lock the taskbar.
1175|All right, dear. Thank you.
1176|Yeah.
1177|It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...
1178|You know, I think she's getting better.
1179|I think she's improving a little bit.
1180|Uh, Lynn, thank you.
1181|YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.
1182|There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,
1183|and even has a shark egg.
1184|Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,
1185|fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.
1186|Watch me put them in.
1187|And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,
1188|what's up, fish heads?
1189|And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.
1190|And it's not even that cool when you see it.
1191|I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...
1192|They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,
1193|really high-quality videos of their tanks.
1194|And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,
1195|and there's, like, relaxing music, so...
1196|That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.
1197|Uh, Kram, thank you so much!
1198|Another big substitute!
1199|It just says,
1200|I'm in!
1201|Thank you so much for the support.
1202|TK, the third big super check!
1203|Thank you so much!
1204|Huh?
1205|Aww, thank you, TK.
1206|So sweet!
1207|I see another one here, but TK, again.
1208|Here, look, he's always so fun.
1209|Game streams, always entertaining.
1210|Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,
1211|but his stream is so comfy,
1212|and video stream projects always spark excitement.
1213|Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!
1214|Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1215|So sweet!
1216|Thank you so much!
1217|I really appreciate it.
1218|I'm glad, uh, you know,
1219|at the end of the day,
1220|if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,
1221|I'm happy, so thank you.
1222|And Majin D, thank you!
1223|Majin 8, thank you!
1224|I'll see you in the bar!
1225|Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,
1226|I hope you get there safe.
1227|I hope you win the lottery one day for the...
1228|not just the regular lottery,
1229|the main green lottery, I guess.
1230|Uh, right here!
1231|Thank you!
1232|Endless Ame!
1233|Only around Halloween.
1234|Rock the guest box!
1235|Ame, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee!
1236|Uh, Roger Liao, thank you!
1237|Ame, ame, ame, ame, ame!
1238|A12 Flames.
1239|Thank you!
1240|Oh!
1241|Oh, the deep skies nuts!
1242|Yeah, that was a tweet that I read during the panel.
1243|Thank you for the question!
1244|Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1245|Oh my god, this song is really loud.
1246|Okay.
1247|Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.
1248|Uh, where was I?
1249|Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1250|Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.
1251|Uh-huh.
1252|Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!
1253|Oh!
1254|Uh, thank you so much!
1255|Thank you!
1256|I hope you also have a yummy food!
1257|Mm-hmm!
1258|Thank you so much for all the support.
1259|I appreciate it.
1260|Nagi!
1261|Oh, thank you!
1262|Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!
1263|Oh, it was really sweet!
1264|Thank you so much!
1265|Nagi's so cute!
1266|So cute!
1267|Yeah, we got some pictures together.
1268|Thank you, thank you for all your support.
1269|I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.
1270|Thank you!
1271|So many cute teammates!
1272|Thank you!
1273|Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.
1274|Did I have any input for the figure?
1275|Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,
1276|but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.
1277|I think it was for that one.
1278|Mm-hmm.
1279|Aaron Pampo, thank you!
1280|Happy birthday!
1281|This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.
1282|Ooh, an amé party!
1283|Dang, amé cake!
1284|Amé day!
1285|No, just kidding.
1286|I hope the cake was tasty.
1287|I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.
1288|Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!
1289|I hope you have a good rest of the day.
1290|Night!
1291|Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?
1292|Amé cake?
1293|Mm-hmm, amé party!
1294|Very cool.
1295|A flag armor, thank you!
1296|I'll be out of blackberries!
1297|No, no, they're still on the...
1298|They left them on the counter, they're still there!
1299|Eduardo, thank you!
1300|Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.
1301|Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?
1302|Did I say that?
1303|Oh...
1304|I don't remember.
1305|Uh...
1306|Yes, just assume that...
1307|Yes, uh-huh.
1308|I could be at 9-9, thank you!
1309|Um, many times, thank you!
1310|Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,
1311|because, you know, the people around you,
1312|if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,
1313|but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,
1314|at least have heard of it.
1315|Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,
1316|so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.
1317|Mm-hmm!
1318|Xinyoung-ho!
1319|Thank you!
1320|Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!
1321|Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,
1322|aim for 22 games in 2022?
1323|How many do I need left?
1324|How many left are there that I need to complete?
1325|I think it's possible, what?
1326|How many months?
1327|We still have 5 months.
1328|I think it's possible.
1329|20 more to go! 19?
1330|Well, I have some shorter games.
1331|Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,
1332|that I think we could do.
1333|But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,
1334|and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,
1335|Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.
1336|I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.
1337|And I know, um,
1338|there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,
1339|but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,
1340|and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,
1341|and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,
1342|like a platform or something, like a 2D.
1343|Ooh, I did want to play, um...
1344|Hey!
1345|What was that one game?
1346|I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.
1347|Uh...
1348|Crash Bandicoot!
1349|Yeah, I'm gonna play.
1350|Stray? I don't know, it looks...
1351|It looks cute, but I don't know.
1352|Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
1353|Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...
1354|Switch?
1355|Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,
1356|I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,
1357|it seems like a game that would take me a while.
1358|Uh...
1359|It is?
1360|Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?
1361|We'll see.
1362|Uh, Multi, thank you.
1363|Aww...
1364|Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.
1365|Mm-hmm.
1366|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1367|Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity
1368|to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.
1369|Mm-hmm.
1370|Anyways, thank you.
1371|Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.
1372|I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.
1373|Have a snack.
1374|Maybe I'll make a sandwich.
1375|Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.
1376|Um, what do you mean, what?
1377|Huh?
1378|Go to start, thank you.
1379|Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.
1380|Agent Quirobo, thank you.
1381|Gracias.
1382|Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.
1383|Would there be a post for the schedule this week?
1384|Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.
1385|I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.
1386|Mm-hmm.
1387|I think I will post something.
1388|I don't know yet.
1389|If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,
1390|like 24 hours before.
1391|Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.
1392|Mm-hmm.
1393|Semen 2016, oh, thank you.
1394|I hope you're having a good day too.
1395|Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed
1396|the Eurotruck sim stream.
1397|You mean?
1398|Yasami-ka!
1399|Thank you.
1400|Antipi, thank you.
1401|Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays
1402|might be a good way to help fill out the week.
1403|Possibly.
1404|That is true.
1405|Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.
1406|I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.
1407|I keep forgetting.
1408|Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.
1409|It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams
1410|that I've done on there, and I will upload them there
1411|for archive reasons.
1412|Archival, is that a word?
1413|Uh...
1414|Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?
1415|No, Bart, thank you.
1416|Where's Super Chat?
1417|Sorry, we do pops here.
1418|I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it
1419|like a, say something bad or something.
1420|Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.
1421|Twitch sucks!
1422|Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective
1423|good to stream every now and then.
1424|Okay, like imagine this.
1425|Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,
1426|and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.
1427|Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.
1428|Now, of course there's discoverability,
1429|you know, possible within YouTube,
1430|and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,
1431|our whole audience is on YouTube.
1432|But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,
1433|a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,
1434|okay, you could have one person
1435|streaming their perspective on Twitch,
1436|and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.
1437|That's business, baby!
1438|But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming
1439|like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,
1440|it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,
1441|I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.
1442|I don't know.
1443|Maybe it's just all in my head.
1444|I gotta check the statistics.
1445|Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.
1446|How about that?
1447|What was the other one?
1448|Video motion.
1449|Thank you.
1450|Thank you.
1451|Oh, gracias.
1452|The motherfucking workers, thank you.
1453|Nanji Misa, arigato.
1454|Ame-chan, kawaii.
1455|Thank you.
1456|Arigato.
1457|Shadowfire, thank you.
1458|Oh, muchas gracias.
1459|Nice.
1460|Ellen Saputro.
1461|Thank you.
1462|Oh, Arowanas.
1463|Yeah, they look cool.
1464|I like them when they're small, when they're babies,
1465|but Arowana is a type of fish.
1466|They get big.
1467|They get really big, and they'll bite you,
1468|and you can bleed and stuff.
1469|It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank
1470|for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.
1471|Boi-boo, boi-boo.
1472|They're so cute when they're small,
1473|because their eyes are really big.
1474|Let me see if I can show a picture.
1475|Whoa, what is this?
1476|They have this sack.
1477|A weird sack.
1478|What is this weird sack that they have?
1479|I'll show you this picture.
1480|Oh, see, they're so cute.
1481|Yeah, they're expensive.
1482|See, they have this little weird sack.
1483|Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?
1484|Because it looks like only the babies have them.
1485|What is that?
1486|They're born with it?
1487|A digestion sack?
1488|Yeah, they get really big, though.
1489|Let's see, fully grown.
1490|Here.
1491|Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.
1492|This is good for perspective.
1493|I don't know who that is,
1494|but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.
1495|Wait, this looks like Photoshop.
1496|No, it's not real.
1497|It's a clickbait image.
1498|They're not that big.
1499|Let's see if I can find a better picture.
1500|Okay, this is a good one.
1501|Bim, bam, bim, bam.
1502|Oh, my God.
1503|Okay.
1504|Okay.
1505|Yeah.
1506|Yeah, they're cute.
1507|Cute, cute.
1508|Omega hot dog.
1509|Thank you.
1510|What do you call an omega that makes gluten-filled bread?
1511|A Watsonburg dishes baking bed.
1512|Ha, ha.
1513|Very funny.
1514|Oh, Julia, thank you.
1515|What?
1516|Halfway.
1517|Thank you.
1518|You done?
1519|Thank you.
1520|I saw a small omelet at this event.
1521|I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.
1522|Yago was also there.
1523|Didn't do anything to him, right?
1524|Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?
1525|Or since earlier today?
1526|Suss.
1527|Suss.
1528|Maka, thank you.
1529|This is a big super chat.
1530|If you don't remember backstaters,
1531|don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.
1532|Let me see.
1533|Grindings like neon white.
1534|Hmm?
1535|Yeah, we'll see.
1536|I just feel like for people watching,
1537|maybe it's like repetitive or something.
1538|I do think it is pretty fun, though.
1539|I don't really mind backstating neon white
1540|because I don't even look at chat
1541|unless I ask you guys a question.
1542|I'm sorry, boy.
1543|Thank you.
1544|Ryan, Quebec.
1545|Thank you.
1546|That's right.
1547|Investigators.
1548|No bathroom breaks.
1549|Investigator breaks only.
1550|Investigator meetings only.
1551|A look-in.
1552|Thank you.
1553|Huh?
1554|Okay.
1555|Face of motion.
1556|Thank you.
1557|Yeah.
1558|Bubble bot.
1559|MVP.
1560|Oh, what's it, Mila 5?
1561|Oh, 1527.
1562|Oh, thank you.
1563|Yes, I'll pick them up.
1564|Thank you.
1565|Lucky senpai.
1566|Thank you.
1567|Oh, at the meet and greet.
1568|Thank you for stopping by.
1569|Thank you for the super chat.
1570|I appreciate it.
1571|Thank you.
1572|Itsu-mo.
1573|Kamalaya.
1574|Is it itsu-mo?
1575|Is it like it always...
1576|It means like it's always or something?
1577|Always.
1578|AirW1, thank you.
1579|Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?
1580|Three fish got battered.
1581|Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?
1582|Oh, I like that one.
1583|That's a good one.
1584|Okay, P-back.
1585|I see.
1586|I see.
1587|Okay.
1588|Hi, Gavin Dorff.
1589|Thank you.
1590|I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.
1591|What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?
1592|I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.
1593|Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.
1594|Something like that?
1595|Oh, what are they called?
1596|Dragon?
1597|Dragon days?
1598|No.
1599|Sea dragons.
1600|Yeah, sea dragons.
1601|And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.
1602|Pipefish, I think?
1603|They're so cute.
1604|Oh, garden eels.
1605|Yeah, I like seeing those types.
1606|Seahorses especially.
1607|You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater
1608|person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses
1609|had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses
1610|in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they
1611|give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue
1612|inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the
1613|tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.
1614|It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.
1615|So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the
1616|seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like
1617|where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels
1618|so that the seahorse can swim normally again.
1619|So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary
1620|to do.
1621|And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.
1622|Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.
1623|Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they
1624|like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like
1625|a build up of gas.
1626|Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.
1627|Mm-hmm.
1628|It's scary.
1629|What does that happen to us?
1630|Maybe it does.
1631|All right.
1632|Hello, thank you.
1633|Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.
1634|Yeah, thank you.
1635|Happy early international cat day to Wellington Henry.
1636|Oh cute, what is that?
1637|International cat day tomorrow?
1638|There's too many, there's too many of these like weird holidays, internet holidays.
1639|Oh my gosh.
1640|Oh my gosh.
1641|Oh my gosh.
1642|Oh my gosh.
1643|Oh my gosh.
1644|Oh my gosh.
1645|Oh my gosh.
1646|Oh my gosh.
1647|Oh my gosh.
1648|Oh my gosh.
1649|Oh my gosh.
1650|What is that, international cat day tomorrow, there's too many of these like weird holidays,
1651|internet holidays.
1652|I'll make sure to give them a treat though.
1653|Epic work, thank you.
1654|Smalmed, we'll take over the world.
1655|That'll one, thank you.
1656|Can I hire Smalmed to come to my birthday party?
1657|That'd be funny.
1658|I'll keep them as a backup plan, yes.
1659|I'll tell Smalmed that could be a good backup plan.
1660|A Vtuber fan, thank you.
1661|Oh, shout out to, I don't know about that, but I really appreciate all the support to
1662|a Vtuber fan, thank you.
1663|Thank you.
1664|Thank you.
1665|Thank you.
1666|Thank you.
1667|You're my main inspiration for becoming a Vtuber, I hope that one day we could collab,
1668|even though the odds are probably super low.
1669|Well, good luck.
1670|It's good to have goals.
1671|Sweet.
1672|Cool, I hope it works out.
1673|For a Kuma Forever one, thank you.
1674|Oh, thank you.
1675|Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
1676|Many times, thank you.
1677|Yeah, right.
1678|I don't mind talking to Bubba, because they're just like, Bubba, you're so cute.
1679|Bubba, you look so handsome today.
1680|Bubba, who's a good boy?
1681|Thank you.
1682|Thank you.
1683|It's fun to watch you go for times.
1684|Oh, and the sunlight.
1685|Thank you.
1686|Well, we'll see.
1687|We'll see this week, maybe.
1688|Vek, thank you.
1689|A red arrow one now.
1690|All right, let's show the class.
1691|Red arrow one now.
1692|Oh, this looks like a fish who could catch an animal crossing.
1693|Oh, I forgot this image was up here.
1694|Mmm, pretty.
1695|It looks like a big betta fish.
1696|Yeah, very bright colored.
1697|Cute.
1698|They're chunky.
1699|Very chunky.
1700|This is a caption on this one.
1701|It's transporting a rare arrow one.
1702|You can see how big it is compared to the arms.
1703|Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.
1704|300 or more.
1705|Hot Cheeto fish.
1706|Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.
1707|Okay, stamps.
1708|This is the last Super Chat.
1709|Don't send it anymore.
1710|If you do, just know that I'm not going to read it.
1711|This is the last Super Chat.
1712|Can I say, thanks so much.
1713|I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,
1714|even though they're not as long as they used to be,
1715|but we get a nice condensed version.
1716|And we have time for other stuff later.
1717|All right, well, you guys have six minutes.
1718|Let me go open up steam.
1719|Uh-huh.
1720|Four titties.
1721|Titties.
1722|30 bucks.
1723|I'll make it back.
1724|Wait, should I get Cities Skyline Deluxe Edition?
1725|Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.
1726|And Harbor means $10 more.
1727|Get the Deluxe.
1728|All right.
1729|Fine.
1730|All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream
1731|because I'm paranoid.
1732|Okay, it's in the cards, though.
1733|All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?
1734|Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.
1735|Oh, my God.
1736|Swimsuit wallpaper.
1737|I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,
1738|which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.
1739|But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.
1740|Oh, no, I'm a doko.
1741|Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.
1742|Yeah, that went well, right?
1743|Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.
1744|I'm going to take a break.
1745|I'm going to clean up an area where I made a mess.
1746|And then I'm going to have a snack.
1747|And then I have to install Cities Skyline, so yes.
1748|Oh, just in time.
1749|Let me pull up the lyrics so I can learn them better.
1750|So fast.
1751|So fast.
1752|So fast.
1753|So fast.
1754|So fast.
1755|So fast.
1756|So fast.
1757|Okay, okay.
1758|So fast.
1759|It's hard to follow along. It's so fast.
1760|So fast.
1761|Thank you guys for watching.
1762|I will see you in an hour.
1763|My PC is so hot.
1764|Okay.
1765|Bye.
1766|Wait, wait, wait.
1767|Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
1768|We didn't reach the two hour mark yet.
1769|Hold on. Hold on.
1770|I'm still going.
1771|So fast.
20|Hello, I
21|Need to push my PC back under my desk. It's too loud. I could hear it. Oh my god. Shut up
22|It's because I was exporting something in from here anyways, sorry. Thank you for waiting everybody. Hello. Welcome to
23|Super Sunday. Hold on. Let me fix one thing
24|Baba bot should be live, right? I hope
25|Baba bot is live, right?
26|Super Sunday. Hello everybody. Thank you guys so much for the super chat. So yeah, this uh
27|This stream is a Sunday. You guys know
28|dedicated to rating super chats
29|Yeah, good to see you guys again. Am I I feel like uh, hold on one second
30|Hi, my head's small, okay, this is better wait, not really
31|That looks normal sort of maybe a little bit bigger
32|It looks
33|somewhat normal, okay
34|My immersion, oh no, oh you'll live you'll live
35|Oh
36|Man I was gonna bring berries
37|I was gonna bring berries to the stream. I had blackberries and I left them in the kitchen
38|Well, I get them later. Yes, uh, Baba is already on although there's no song requests open
39|I'm gonna open up the song cue now
40|Give me one a moment
41|How can you add songs great question
42|well
43|you would do exclamation point SR which stands for song request and then put the link of the song you would like to request in
44|in the chat of Bubba, but
45|Which I don't remember the
46|Command is it working? Oh
47|Hold on, let me check something really quick one sec
48|You
49|Okay, now Bubba about his playing can you guys hear it sorry I had to hold on
50|Okay
51|Okay, yeah, it's loud okay, I'll turn down a little bit
52|Okay, turn it down is that better
53|You can hear now, okay cool. So yeah, the key is already open and it fills up really fast because you guys are like
54|robots
55|Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm
56|Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know
57|I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm
58|Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream
59|But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed
60|And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out
61|So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub
62|It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower
63|Mm-hmm
64|Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle
65|So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably
66|I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover
67|Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins
68|They're pretty good. I think I
69|Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I
70|Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead
71|Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a
72|It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you
73|Where is it, um
74|Let's see
75|Okay
76|Weird hold on let me cut there for a second
77|Oh
78|Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?
79|Disappeared
80|The office is gone
81|Doesn't make any sense
82|Don't make no sense. Wait
83|There's that
84|It's probably just like an OBS problem
85|Oh
86|What if I duplicate
87|All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh
88|Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here
89|Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office
90|I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect
91|We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh
92|And it's like it looks 3d
93|Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else
94|Are you guys doing today on this Sunday? Oh
95|That's better now it doesn't look like I'm reading although my arms look so big
96|Good
97|Does that work

100|That's a little bit better maybe just a tiny bit
101|Wait, is this is this lined up this where is this supposed to be? Oh here looks so high
102|Okay, well what it looks scuff to me wait, okay, I just don't look don't look don't look don't look
103|What happened to Papa but is it playing cuz I don't hear anything
104|Is it just a really quiet song is there just like a minute of silence at the end of a song or something
105|It stopped it broke
106|But it only lets me play this one song. Well, then let me reload it really quick
107|Okay, hopefully that fixed it. Yeah, I guess it has to be this way. Very funny. Very funny. Yeah
108|Shoot
109|I'm trying to hide this misaligned pillow. Oh, what is this? Maybe if I
110|Look the pillow has like a little bite taken out of it. I think it's supposed to go by this armrest, but it don't fit
111|So I'm a lid I won't fit

115|All right, so we have all gathered here today
116|To give thanks for thy super chats
117|Uh
118|Wait, does anybody know where from where I'm reading from super chat's from my head is too big
119|Oh
120|Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you
121|Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank
122|Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about
123|Oh
124|You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs
125|I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to
126|Just to like go outside and talk
127|with person at the store
128|But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream
129|I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I
130|Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just
131|Not healthy for my tummy. Oh
132|What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule
133|Oh
134|Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up
135|For the next
136|The next coming this coming week, let's see
137|I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was
138|Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday
139|Wait, yes, it was a Monday
140|No
141|It was on Tuesday
142|Okay, okay
143|Sorry, sorry
144|Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule
145|sort of
146|Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring
147|starting at AMT time and
148|Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think
149|So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier
150|So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week
151|Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet
152|If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream
153|I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream
154|So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know
155|I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and
156|Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring
157|I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark
158|So I'm not sure
159|If it's gonna be on that day
160|But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh
161|Then on Friday
162|What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one
163|Keep having to refresh it every time
164|Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now
165|I
166|I
167|I
168|Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something
169|That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing
170|All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday
171|We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again
172|Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some
173|Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it
174|Is that like a bird an alarm
175|Alright super chats from
176|Five days ago got it. Oh
177|But before we read super chat, she's gonna see look look look wait
178|Oh
179|Look at this wait, it's too big
180|Hold on oh
181|It's gone and disappeared what the heck
182|Oh
183|It's gone oh
184|Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today
185|Look at the starfish
186|Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank
187|But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it
188|Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose
189|to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so
190|Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass
191|It's cute, right?
192|You can see the mouth in the center there
193|Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy
194|Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the
195|You know the land
196|The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to
197|Yeah, both it's both weird
198|Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small
199|so small and then also
200|Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small
201|This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought
202|It's um
203|Can I use the point?
204|It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer
205|like a little cursor to drag around the screen
206|Alright, I'll point with
207|This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone
208|I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and
209|the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and
210|Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?
211|it's
212|Okay, the video was unavailable
213|Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned
214|I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh
215|Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is
216|It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning
217|They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab
218|Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting
219|things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and
220|In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone
221|So they have like a really cute relationship
222|Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them
223|Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm
224|Now you could see it
225|It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything
226|This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too
227|Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it
228|Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color
229|Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it
230|But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm
231|So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know
232|I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing
233|So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and
234|Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm
235|But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it
236|I want to protect it
237|Yeah, this a anemone
238|It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute
239|They're so cute. And then
240|And then let me see, hold on
241|Hold on
242|Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in
243|Okay, now I will show you guys
244|The frog
245|After I change something really quick
246|Um
247|This one
248|Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm
249|You frog
250|Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up
251|All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels
252|There's one of the frogs
253|Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um
254|He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water
255|They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air
256|And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air
257|Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together
258|But let me see
259|No, this is the only picture I have actually
260|Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again
261|Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them
262|Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny
263|Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out
264|Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space
265|Yeah, we'll see
266|Look at them. I need to zoom in
267|Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them
268|But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams
269|Seems cute
270|What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets
271|They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face
272|They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning
273|And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing
274|So it was getting a mouthful of sand
275|Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it
276|No, they don't usually bother shrimp
277|Not that I've seen anyway
278|I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth
279|But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything
280|I
281|Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys
282|Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted
283|But it doesn't look like we have too much to go
284|I didn't have to scroll too much to get down to these super chats now reading from the apex collab with a mume

304|Thank you. Yeah, I'm not that great at apex. I think I think I might be better at fortnight. Actually, I don't know. Yeah
305|I'm not that good at FPS games. I think I have my moments in like FPS games
306|But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good
307|I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well
308|Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates
309|They start messing around in the game
310|Yeah, it's it's well
311|It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to
312|Mm-hmm

319|Let me see if everything's still there it is it is oh my god if I were playing it now I would get
320|hold on it's spinning if
321|I if I were playing the wheel now, we'd be playing heroes of the storm
322|Now members camp over wheel games I put stuff on the wheel that I feel like I wouldn't mind playing
323|Thank you
324|Yeah, here's the soul well, we'll have to see on the day the day of wheel
325|They have wheel ah speaking of which yeah, I'll do it after the stream for sure wait

337|I'm reading super chat. So thank you so much for support
338|Bonsie, thank you
339|Well, the thing is yes as you should turn you should turn back on the screen when playing apex as you're about to land
340|So then nobody can follow you but it's difficult because if I'm the jump master
341|I have to be tapped into the game to
342|Well, I could put it on a hotkey
343|Yeah, I could put it on a hockey like uh, I
344|Guess it would be like this. Hold on. Let me see I can show you guys a demonstration if you will
345|Like that it would be just like that. Yeah, I'll put it on a hockey. That's a good idea. Thanks. I'm it
346|Okay, 360 monkey. Thank you
347|Get in times to thank you reindeer. Thank you a worthless old crinkle. Oh
348|Thank you
349|Rick. Thank you
350|Yeah, the readers are good. Well, I don't know it depends
351|I only want to eat like a Dorito maybe like once every six months or something. I don't know
352|I don't really have cravings for chips
353|Yeah
354|It's a lessons. Thank you
355|And new a sign I got dog
356|Can you stay I was a thank you. I shoot a sucky. Thank you gentlemen
357|Thank you. Oh, yeah, I learned something today
358|Well, it was like while I was reading
359|researching some stuff
360|Apparently if you guys look at your nails right now
361|Do you guys have like a little white half moon at the bottom part of your nail where it like connects to your finger?
362|Do you guys have that check check?
363|everybody check
364|Yes, yes, yep, nope. No. Yes. Yes
365|Yeah, it's called the wait. I forget what it's called Luna lei. I think Luna lei
366|Uh-huh. Yeah, it means yet. It means if you're missing it, it might mean that you have
367|issues with like nutrition or vitamins
368|Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name
369|Yeah, it's called a Luna lei
370|Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and
371|And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions
372|It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways
373|But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something
374|That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I
375|Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe
376|Oh
377|That's good, maybe my I guess my feet are healthier
378|Yeah, yeah looking at look up it's like when you can tell what color it's like the color of stuff that comes out of your
379|Body indicates, you know like things in your body, right?
380|Yeah, I'm all nervous from lack of I'm a
381|Okay, okay. Oh, yeah, I like this song nice. Okay. Oh, where was I reading super chats back to super chats?
382|Pick a right thing here. Oh, that would be cool. I need toe. Thank you. It is named on sites with fuse old for six times
383|zoom, oh
384|I want to play more fuse
385|Is the season starting again soon on apex? Maybe I'll give it the good old try
386|I'll try hard
387|We'll see I
388|Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it
389|It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch
390|It takes less time. Well, I don't know
391|I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex
392|Maybe it's not that much time
393|But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die
394|Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though
395|Hmm
396|Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something
397|Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob
398|Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh
399|Okay
400|Sorry, I have this like leftover
401|Skin bubble from a blister. I just felt that you
402|You
403|Okay
404|Our name was Oda
405|Okay, uh
406|What was I
407|What'd you do? Thank you. I don't like thank you. I lost saying room. Thank you. Good to be
408|Good. Yeah, so you say you cover with nami mamos absolute fire. Oh, thank you. I'm glad you liked it. I
409|Just cuz the Batman. Thank you. I'll fall in walls
410|Thank you so much, I appreciate the support
411|But the button

702|I was just like looking through Pixel
703|and I was trying so many different pictures
704|and like it's just that, you know,
705|having blonde hair and being super pale,
706|it's kind of hard with contrast,
707|like to find a good image that contrasts properly
708|for like a small profile picture.
709|So I was just Googling my name
710|and looking through the images and I found this one
711|and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images
712|I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.
713|So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.
714|So I decided to keep it.
715|Magic, magic.
716|Oh, right dude, thank you.
717|Yuste, kam samita.

724|like some pictures of some very dedicated
725|Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,
726|like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.
727|I think they were camping out like at midnight,
728|waiting for it to open
729|because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.
730|So take some dedication, you know.
731|It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout
732|for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.
733|Yeah, they're very dedicated
734|and they seem really happy too.
735|I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.
736|It'd be awesome.
737|Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,
738|but still.
739|Yeah, that's true.

813|Damn, you could fit a lot of carrots in like a 22-foot long truck, huh?
814|Like tons and tons of carrots.
815|Whoa.
816|Okay, thank you.
817|This is harder than me landing on a sun station or parking a truck.
818|The sun station took way longer.
819|Mila, what's up, Detective Extraordinaire, thank you.
820|Hey, Solasos, thank you.
821|Wouldn't it be cool if truck sim had a Fallout mod?

865|Rekukun, thank you.
866|Oh, oh, yes.
867|It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,
868|but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,
869|I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,
870|close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert
871|and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short
872|because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.
873|Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?
874|Aw, cool.
875|Yeah, it was really cool.
876|I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,
877|so her voice was not that great.
878|She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,
879|so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,
880|but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,
881|it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?
882|And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.
883|It's so cool.
884|Mm-hmm, so magical.
885|Aw, where was I?
886|Aw, I made me a thank you.
887|How was it to meet some of your fans?
888|I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,
889|so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,
890|well, how was your convention going?
891|Did you see the KFP stand?
892|I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?
893|Did you see the Artist Alley?
894|How many did I meet?
895|I think, I don't know the exact number,
896|but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.
897|I think a little bit more than 20.
898|Aw, okay, good, thank you.
899|I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.
900|Good, it's a bad influence.
901|Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.
902|It was just some guy in the crowd.
903|Ms. Mint, thank you.
904|Yeah, we made a thank you.
905|Can I ask about the coin purse?
906|It's super cute and I want one.
907|I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,
908|like a long time ago.
909|Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.
910|Pickle Rick, thank you.
911|Next meeting greets, yeah.
912|I wouldn't mind doing them as often.
913|This is convention season still right now,
914|but during convention season I don't mind doing it.
915|It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.
916|I think doing the panel was more difficult
917|than doing the meeting greets because,
918|well, usually in the past when we do panels,
919|there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC
920|who deals with handling the crowd
921|and asking questions and things like that
922|and just keeping the flow going for the panel,
923|but because it was up to each of us,
924|Good and I were talking about different ideas
925|that we could do for the panel,
926|and we just didn't come to a conclusion
927|of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.
928|I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,
929|and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.
930|So we had a lot of ideas,
931|but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,
932|like, oh, just, you know, questions.
933|MeTuber support, okay.
934|It was easy.
935|And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,
936|so I really wanted to, you know,
937|work with that too and do a little musical thing.
938|Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.
939|I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.
940|If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.
941|If I could even get that effect in OBS,
942|which it kind of worked.
943|I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.
944|I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.
945|But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll
946|if we could hand out.
947|I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.
948|If we could hand out like blue and red,
949|those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,
950|something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.
951|I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.
952|You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.
953|But I think it was too last minute anyways.
954|Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.
955|I don't even know how that would be possible.
956|I know you can rent 3D glasses.
957|You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,
958|but those work differently.
959|It's like it takes...
960|Hmm.
961|I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.
962|It like polarizes light circularly.
963|And so what it is, is like when you're watching
964|one of those 3D movies in theaters,
965|is they have like two projectors going,
966|or one that switches really fast back and forth,
967|and they're polarized.
968|Circularly polarized in opposite directions,
969|and each lens only allows one directional,
970|one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.
971|I think I get it.
972|Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.
973|Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.
974|Unless we had a special projector.
975|It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.
976|How do they work?
977|Um...
978|Okay, yeah, light wave physics.
979|It was interesting watching.
980|I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,
981|but this is like pretty complicated.
982|They like talking about, you know, the light waves
983|and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.
984|And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.
985|I don't even think I took a physics class.
986|Oh, no.
987|I kind of took a physics class, yeah.
988|Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.
989|Two YouTube tutorials later.
990|How do magnets work?
991|I don't know, how do they work?
992|It's magic.
993|Um...
994|Let's see.
995|Where was I?
996|Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.
997|Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,
998|I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,
999|I guess it sort of implied there might be something else
1000|coming up soon, so I don't know.
1001|I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,
1002|it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,
1003|but I'm not sure yet.
1004|Uh, no confirmations yet.
1005|Uh, Vercatos, thank you.
1006|Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.
1007|My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember
1008|some of the anime that I really liked.
1009|So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked
1010|and that I remembered that I liked,
1011|but I think there's some anime that I really liked too
1012|that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.
1013|Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?
1014|Congratulations!
1015|A marriage, whoa!
1016|Nice, thank you for the support.
1017|I hope they have a successful marriage.
1018|Marriage.
1019|SS109, thank you.
1020|Picoric, thank you.
1021|Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?
1022|Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.
1023|It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.
1024|Um...
1025|Amidoko kamsamita!
1026|Ah, come on way up.
1027|Fates, thank you.
1028|Yo, yo, yo.
1029|I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.
1030|Amazing sand, thank you.
1031|Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing
1032|for next year's Crunchyroll convention,
1033|but it did seem like a lot of fun,
1034|especially I just tweeted something before the stream.
1035|Everybody's like, ame, ame.
1036|And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.
1037|A small ame was there dancing.
1038|Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.
1039|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1040|It doesn't have to be, you know,
1041|only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.
1042|Um...
1043|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1044|Super Sunday time.
1045|Stratus fight, thank you.
1046|Immediates, thank you.
1047|Bus, thank you.
1048|You can get a degree at the panel the other day.
1049|Thanks so well.
1050|How different was it singing
1051|and being able to watch the crowd?
1052|Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...
1053|Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,
1054|I wasn't watching the crowd
1055|because I was looking at the lyrics.
1056|But, um, yeah, like I said,
1057|watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.
1058|Mm-hmm.
1059|And Smart Boy, thank you.
1060|Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.
1061|Puru put it in at this point.
1062|But you just don't know.
1063|I just wanted to make sure I got it right.
1064|Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.
1065|That'd be cool.
1066|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1067|Tried making amine last night.
1068|It tasted pretty good.
1069|Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.
1070|I'm glad you liked it.
1071|Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.
1072|Aww.
1073|Oh, thank you.
1074|Thank you for the question.
1075|I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.
1076|I-R-L.
1077|Mm-hmm.
1078|Yeah, I'm done.
1079|Mm-hmm.
1080|Yesterday, I got something to do.
1081|This song sounds...
1082|This song sounds kind of sad.
1083|But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.
1084|Alpha 9 5 7 1.
1085|Ooh.
1086|Cool.
1087|Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.
1088|Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.
1089|Thank you.
1090|Thank you.
1091|Thank you.
1092|Aww, thank you.
1093|I'm glad you enjoyed.
1094|Wait.
1095|Thank you.
1096|I'll see you laughing.
1097|Thank you.
1098|Ask Pei.
1099|Thank you.
1100|Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?
1101|Maybe, perhaps?
1102|Uh, I think it's an affiliate.
1103|I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.
1104|Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.
1105|So, I'll, uh, get started on that.
1106|Mm-hmm.
1107|Ifmefa, thank you.
1108|Oh.
1109|Aww, thank you.
1110|Aww, thank you.
1111|Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.
1112|Esta ludos desde Chile.
1113|Oh, Chile.
1114|Very chill.
1115|Muchas gracias.
1116|Anti-whippy, thank you.
1117|It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.
1118|She even became Ian's old mascot.
1119|You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?
1120|Oh.
1121|Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.
1122|I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.
1123|So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.
1124|You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.
1125|So, yeah.
1126|But, yeah, it is really crazy.
1127|It is surprising.
1128|But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,
1129|and people started using them in memes.
1130|So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.
1131|She's, like, 40 now.
1132|Small Aime is the real idol here.
1133|Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.
1134|What do you guys think?
1135|Oh, there's an idea.
1136|Hey, I can do it on my own.
1137|Well, not all alone, but...
1138|Huh.
1139|All right, well, stay tuned.
1140|Flynn Playmable, thank you.
1141|Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.
1142|TK, thank you.
1143|First, Akka Super Chat.
1144|Oh, that was a solid one.
1145|Thank you so much, TK.
1146|Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.
1147|Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.
1148|Thank you.
1149|At TotoCubes, thank you.
1150|Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?
1151|Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.
1152|Me too.
1153|Last time, 39. Thank you.
1154|The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.
1155|It looks so good.
1156|Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.
1157|Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?
1158|Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...
1159|Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.
1160|Right next, thank you.
1161|Does Mama get put back in the box?
1162|Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.
1163|I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?
1164|At TK, thank you.
1165|Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.
1166|Aw.
1167|Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.
1168|I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.
1169|Thank you, thank you for the support.
1170|Thank you.
1171|Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.
1172|I'm in it all night.
1173|Rock the gas bar. Rock the...
1174|Lock the taskbar.
1175|All right, dear. Thank you.
1176|Yeah.
1177|It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...
1178|You know, I think she's getting better.
1179|I think she's improving a little bit.
1180|Uh, Lynn, thank you.
1181|YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.
1182|There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,
1183|and even has a shark egg.
1184|Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,
1185|fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.
1186|Watch me put them in.
1187|And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,
1188|what's up, fish heads?
1189|And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.
1190|And it's not even that cool when you see it.
1191|I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...
1192|They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,
1193|really high-quality videos of their tanks.
1194|And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,
1195|and there's, like, relaxing music, so...
1196|That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.
1197|Uh, Kram, thank you so much!
1198|Another big substitute!
1199|It just says,
1200|I'm in!
1201|Thank you so much for the support.
1202|TK, the third big super check!
1203|Thank you so much!
1204|Huh?
1205|Aww, thank you, TK.
1206|So sweet!
1207|I see another one here, but TK, again.
1208|Here, look, he's always so fun.
1209|Game streams, always entertaining.
1210|Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,
1211|but his stream is so comfy,
1212|and video stream projects always spark excitement.
1213|Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!
1214|Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1215|So sweet!
1216|Thank you so much!
1217|I really appreciate it.
1218|I'm glad, uh, you know,
1219|at the end of the day,
1220|if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,
1221|I'm happy, so thank you.
1222|And Majin D, thank you!
1223|Majin 8, thank you!
1224|I'll see you in the bar!
1225|Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,
1226|I hope you get there safe.
1227|I hope you win the lottery one day for the...
1228|not just the regular lottery,
1229|the main green lottery, I guess.
1230|Uh, right here!
1231|Thank you!
1232|Endless Ame!
1233|Only around Halloween.
1234|Rock the guest box!
1235|Ame, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee!
1236|Uh, Roger Liao, thank you!
1237|Ame, ame, ame, ame, ame!
1238|A12 Flames.
1239|Thank you!
1240|Oh!
1241|Oh, the deep skies nuts!
1242|Yeah, that was a tweet that I read during the panel.
1243|Thank you for the question!
1244|Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1245|Oh my god, this song is really loud.
1246|Okay.
1247|Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.
1248|Uh, where was I?
1249|Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1250|Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.
1251|Uh-huh.
1252|Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!
1253|Oh!
1254|Uh, thank you so much!
1255|Thank you!
1256|I hope you also have a yummy food!
1257|Mm-hmm!
1258|Thank you so much for all the support.
1259|I appreciate it.
1260|Nagi!
1261|Oh, thank you!
1262|Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!
1263|Oh, it was really sweet!
1264|Thank you so much!
1265|Nagi's so cute!
1266|So cute!
1267|Yeah, we got some pictures together.
1268|Thank you, thank you for all your support.
1269|I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.
1270|Thank you!
1271|So many cute teammates!
1272|Thank you!
1273|Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.
1274|Did I have any input for the figure?
1275|Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,
1276|but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.
1277|I think it was for that one.
1278|Mm-hmm.
1279|Aaron Pampo, thank you!
1280|Happy birthday!
1281|This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.
1282|Ooh, an amé party!
1283|Dang, amé cake!
1284|Amé day!
1285|No, just kidding.
1286|I hope the cake was tasty.
1287|I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.
1288|Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!
1289|I hope you have a good rest of the day.
1290|Night!
1291|Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?
1292|Amé cake?
1293|Mm-hmm, amé party!
1294|Very cool.
1295|A flag armor, thank you!
1296|I'll be out of blackberries!
1297|No, no, they're still on the...
1298|They left them on the counter, they're still there!
1299|Eduardo, thank you!
1300|Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.
1301|Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?
1302|Did I say that?
1303|Oh...
1304|I don't remember.
1305|Uh...
1306|Yes, just assume that...
1307|Yes, uh-huh.
1308|I could be at 9-9, thank you!
1309|Um, many times, thank you!
1310|Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,
1311|because, you know, the people around you,
1312|if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,
1313|but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,
1314|at least have heard of it.
1315|Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,
1316|so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.
1317|Mm-hmm!
1318|Xinyoung-ho!
1319|Thank you!
1320|Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!
1321|Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,
1322|aim for 22 games in 2022?
1323|How many do I need left?
1324|How many left are there that I need to complete?
1325|I think it's possible, what?
1326|How many months?
1327|We still have 5 months.
1328|I think it's possible.
1329|20 more to go! 19?
1330|Well, I have some shorter games.
1331|Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,
1332|that I think we could do.
1333|But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,
1334|and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,
1335|Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.
1336|I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.
1337|And I know, um,
1338|there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,
1339|but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,
1340|and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,
1341|and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,
1342|like a platform or something, like a 2D.
1343|Ooh, I did want to play, um...
1344|Hey!
1345|What was that one game?
1346|I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.
1347|Uh...
1348|Crash Bandicoot!
1349|Yeah, I'm gonna play.
1350|Stray? I don't know, it looks...
1351|It looks cute, but I don't know.
1352|Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
1353|Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...
1354|Switch?
1355|Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,
1356|I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,
1357|it seems like a game that would take me a while.
1358|Uh...
1359|It is?
1360|Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?
1361|We'll see.
1362|Uh, Multi, thank you.
1363|Aww...
1364|Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.
1365|Mm-hmm.
1366|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1367|Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity
1368|to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.
1369|Mm-hmm.
1370|Anyways, thank you.
1371|Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.
1372|I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.
1373|Have a snack.
1374|Maybe I'll make a sandwich.
1375|Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.
1376|Um, what do you mean, what?
1377|Huh?
1378|Go to start, thank you.
1379|Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.
1380|Agent Quirobo, thank you.
1381|Gracias.
1382|Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.
1383|Would there be a post for the schedule this week?
1384|Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.
1385|I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.
1386|Mm-hmm.
1387|I think I will post something.
1388|I don't know yet.
1389|If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,
1390|like 24 hours before.
1391|Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.
1392|Mm-hmm.
1393|Semen 2016, oh, thank you.
1394|I hope you're having a good day too.
1395|Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed
1396|the Eurotruck sim stream.
1397|You mean?
1398|Yasami-ka!
1399|Thank you.
1400|Antipi, thank you.
1401|Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays
1402|might be a good way to help fill out the week.
1403|Possibly.
1404|That is true.
1405|Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.
1406|I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.
1407|I keep forgetting.
1408|Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.
1409|It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams
1410|that I've done on there, and I will upload them there
1411|for archive reasons.
1412|Archival, is that a word?
1413|Uh...
1414|Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?
1415|No, Bart, thank you.
1416|Where's Super Chat?
1417|Sorry, we do pops here.
1418|I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it
1419|like a, say something bad or something.
1420|Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.
1421|Twitch sucks!
1422|Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective
1423|good to stream every now and then.
1424|Okay, like imagine this.
1425|Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,
1426|and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.
1427|Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.
1428|Now, of course there's discoverability,
1429|you know, possible within YouTube,
1430|and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,
1431|our whole audience is on YouTube.
1432|But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,
1433|a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,
1434|okay, you could have one person
1435|streaming their perspective on Twitch,
1436|and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.
1437|That's business, baby!
1438|But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming
1439|like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,
1440|it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,
1441|I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.
1442|I don't know.
1443|Maybe it's just all in my head.
1444|I gotta check the statistics.
1445|Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.
1446|How about that?
1447|What was the other one?
1448|Video motion.
1449|Thank you.
1450|Thank you.
1451|Oh, gracias.
1452|The motherfucking workers, thank you.
1453|Nanji Misa, arigato.
1454|Ame-chan, kawaii.
1455|Thank you.
1456|Arigato.
1457|Shadowfire, thank you.
1458|Oh, muchas gracias.
1459|Nice.
1460|Ellen Saputro.
1461|Thank you.
1462|Oh, Arowanas.
1463|Yeah, they look cool.
1464|I like them when they're small, when they're babies,
1465|but Arowana is a type of fish.
1466|They get big.
1467|They get really big, and they'll bite you,
1468|and you can bleed and stuff.
1469|It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank
1470|for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.
1471|Boi-boo, boi-boo.
1472|They're so cute when they're small,
1473|because their eyes are really big.
1474|Let me see if I can show a picture.
1475|Whoa, what is this?
1476|They have this sack.
1477|A weird sack.
1478|What is this weird sack that they have?
1479|I'll show you this picture.
1480|Oh, see, they're so cute.
1481|Yeah, they're expensive.
1482|See, they have this little weird sack.
1483|Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?
1484|Because it looks like only the babies have them.
1485|What is that?
1486|They're born with it?
1487|A digestion sack?
1488|Yeah, they get really big, though.
1489|Let's see, fully grown.
1490|Here.
1491|Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.
1492|This is good for perspective.
1493|I don't know who that is,
1494|but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.
1495|Wait, this looks like Photoshop.
1496|No, it's not real.
1497|It's a clickbait image.
1498|They're not that big.
1499|Let's see if I can find a better picture.
1500|Okay, this is a good one.
1501|Bim, bam, bim, bam.
1502|Oh, my God.
1503|Okay.
1504|Okay.
1505|Yeah.
1506|Yeah, they're cute.
1507|Cute, cute.
1508|Omega hot dog.
1509|Thank you.
1510|What do you call an omega that makes gluten-filled bread?

1519|Thank you.
1520|I saw a small omelet at this event.
1521|I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.
1522|Yago was also there.
1523|Didn't do anything to him, right?
1524|Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?
1525|Or since earlier today?
1526|Suss.
1527|Suss.
1528|Maka, thank you.
1529|This is a big super chat.
1530|If you don't remember backstaters,
1531|don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.
1532|Let me see.
1533|Grindings like neon white.
1534|Hmm?
1535|Yeah, we'll see.
1536|I just feel like for people watching,
1537|maybe it's like repetitive or something.
1538|I do think it is pretty fun, though.
1539|I don't really mind backstating neon white
1540|because I don't even look at chat
1541|unless I ask you guys a question.
1542|I'm sorry, boy.
1543|Thank you.
1544|Ryan, Quebec.
1545|Thank you.

1576|It means like it's always or something?
1577|Always.
1578|AirW1, thank you.
1579|Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?
1580|Three fish got battered.
1581|Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?
1582|Oh, I like that one.
1583|That's a good one.
1584|Okay, P-back.
1585|I see.
1586|I see.
1587|Okay.
1588|Hi, Gavin Dorff.
1589|Thank you.
1590|I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.
1591|What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?
1592|I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.
1593|Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.
1594|Something like that?
1595|Oh, what are they called?
1596|Dragon?
1597|Dragon days?
1598|No.
1599|Sea dragons.
1600|Yeah, sea dragons.
1601|And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.
1602|Pipefish, I think?
1603|They're so cute.
1604|Oh, garden eels.
1605|Yeah, I like seeing those types.
1606|Seahorses especially.
1607|You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater
1608|person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses
1609|had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses
1610|in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they
1611|give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue
1612|inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the
1613|tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.
1614|It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.
1615|So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the
1616|seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like
1617|where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels
1618|so that the seahorse can swim normally again.
1619|So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary
1620|to do.
1621|And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.
1622|Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.
1623|Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they
1624|like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like
1625|a build up of gas.
1626|Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.
1627|Mm-hmm.
1628|It's scary.
1629|What does that happen to us?
1630|Maybe it does.
1631|All right.
1632|Hello, thank you.
1633|Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.
1634|Yeah, thank you.
1635|Happy early international cat day to Wellington Henry.
1636|Oh cute, what is that?

1654|Smalmed, we'll take over the world.
1655|That'll one, thank you.
1656|Can I hire Smalmed to come to my birthday party?
1657|That'd be funny.
1658|I'll keep them as a backup plan, yes.
1659|I'll tell Smalmed that could be a good backup plan.
1660|A Vtuber fan, thank you.
1661|Oh, shout out to, I don't know about that, but I really appreciate all the support to
1662|a Vtuber fan, thank you.
1663|Thank you.
1664|Thank you.
1665|Thank you.
1666|Thank you.
1667|You're my main inspiration for becoming a Vtuber, I hope that one day we could collab,
1668|even though the odds are probably super low.
1669|Well, good luck.
1670|It's good to have goals.
1671|Sweet.
1672|Cool, I hope it works out.
1673|For a Kuma Forever one, thank you.
1674|Oh, thank you.
1675|Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
1676|Many times, thank you.
1677|Yeah, right.
1678|I don't mind talking to Bubba, because they're just like, Bubba, you're so cute.
1679|Bubba, you look so handsome today.
1680|Bubba, who's a good boy?
1681|Thank you.
1682|Thank you.
1683|It's fun to watch you go for times.
1684|Oh, and the sunlight.
1685|Thank you.
1686|Well, we'll see.
1687|We'll see this week, maybe.
1688|Vek, thank you.
1689|A red arrow one now.
1690|All right, let's show the class.
1691|Red arrow one now.
1692|Oh, this looks like a fish who could catch an animal crossing.
1693|Oh, I forgot this image was up here.
1694|Mmm, pretty.
1695|It looks like a big betta fish.
1696|Yeah, very bright colored.
1697|Cute.
1698|They're chunky.
1699|Very chunky.
1700|This is a caption on this one.
1701|It's transporting a rare arrow one.
1702|You can see how big it is compared to the arms.
1703|Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.
1704|300 or more.
1705|Hot Cheeto fish.
1706|Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.
1707|Okay, stamps.
1708|This is the last Super Chat.
1709|Don't send it anymore.
1710|If you do, just know that I'm not going to read it.
1711|This is the last Super Chat.
1712|Can I say, thanks so much.
1713|I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,
1714|even though they're not as long as they used to be,
1715|but we get a nice condensed version.
1716|And we have time for other stuff later.
1717|All right, well, you guys have six minutes.
1718|Let me go open up steam.
1719|Uh-huh.
1720|Four titties.
1721|Titties.
1722|30 bucks.
1723|I'll make it back.
1724|Wait, should I get Cities Skyline Deluxe Edition?
1725|Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.
1726|And Harbor means $10 more.
1727|Get the Deluxe.
1728|All right.
1729|Fine.
1730|All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream
1731|because I'm paranoid.
1732|Okay, it's in the cards, though.
1733|All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?
1734|Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.
1735|Oh, my God.
1736|Swimsuit wallpaper.
1737|I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,
1738|which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.
1739|But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.
1740|Oh, no, I'm a doko.
1741|Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.
1742|Yeah, that went well, right?
1743|Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.
1744|I'm going to take a break.
1745|I'm going to clean up an area where I made a mess.
1746|And then I'm going to have a snack.
1747|And then I have to install Cities Skyline, so yes.
1748|Oh, just in time.
1749|Let me pull up the lyrics so I can learn them better.

29|Yeah, good to see you guys again. Am I I feel like uh, hold on one second
30|Hi, my head's small, okay, this is better wait, not really
31|That looks normal sort of maybe a little bit bigger
32|It looks
33|somewhat normal, okay
34|My immersion, oh no, oh you'll live you'll live
35|Oh
36|Man I was gonna bring berries
37|I was gonna bring berries to the stream. I had blackberries and I left them in the kitchen
38|Well, I get them later. Yes, uh, Baba is already on although there's no song requests open
39|I'm gonna open up the song cue now
40|Give me one a moment
41|How can you add songs great question
42|well
43|you would do exclamation point SR which stands for song request and then put the link of the song you would like to request in
44|in the chat of Bubba, but
45|Which I don't remember the
46|Command is it working? Oh
47|Hold on, let me check something really quick one sec
48|You
49|Okay, now Bubba about his playing can you guys hear it sorry I had to hold on
50|Okay
51|Okay, yeah, it's loud okay, I'll turn down a little bit
52|Okay, turn it down is that better
53|You can hear now, okay cool. So yeah, the key is already open and it fills up really fast because you guys are like
54|robots
55|Just on top of it. So it's likely that the queue is already filled. Mm-hmm
56|Now I don't know if we're gonna finish the queue this stream because the stream will probably be I don't know
57|I was assuming it would be wouldn't be that long of a stream. So we'll see. Mm-hmm
58|Yeah lately lately my energy has been really low even though I try not to show it on stream
59|But it's kind of just like waking up is uh, sometimes just like oh getting out of bed
60|And I think it's cuz I keep ordering out no more ordering out
61|So today I had a delicious breakfast of leftover rice and oh some seaweed that like I got in the tub
62|It's like the seaweed salad and eggs and some leftover cauliflower
63|Mm-hmm
64|Yeah, cuz even my my my my nails like break super easily. They're like really brittle
65|So I think it's just a nutrients thing. So I've been really low on energy. So these streams probably
66|I'll try to go for as long as I can but I don't know for until it until I recover
67|Yeah, the streams might be just a little short yeah, I take vitamins I take a gummy bear vitamins
68|They're pretty good. I think I
69|Can't eat two of them. It's better than just eating one. It's like a Flintstone gummy. Yeah, I
70|Think it might switch to the office. I mean we're in the office, but I mean it might go to my desk instead
71|Hold on. Oh, yeah, I put it like a
72|It puts some crazy filters on my office trying to make it 3d. Hold on. Let me tell you
73|Where is it, um
74|Let's see
75|Okay
76|Weird hold on let me cut there for a second
77|Oh
78|Where is it maybe if I do there's music playing, huh?
79|Disappeared
80|The office is gone
81|Doesn't make any sense
82|Don't make no sense. Wait
83|There's that
84|It's probably just like an OBS problem
85|Oh
86|What if I duplicate
87|All same issue, maybe I just have too many things on this. Oh
88|Those dreams I think sorry. Okay, I guess we'll stay here
89|Yeah, I tried to check earlier, but I guess cuz I was trying to do I was trying to put the office
90|I was trying to make it like give it this cool 3d effect
91|We're like, you know how you look at something with the red and blue glasses. Oh
92|And it's like it looks 3d
93|Yeah, I was gonna do that. Well, let me check something else
94|Are you guys doing today on this Sunday? Oh
95|That's better now it doesn't look like I'm reading although my arms look so big

105|It stopped it broke
106|But it only lets me play this one song. Well, then let me reload it really quick
107|Okay, hopefully that fixed it. Yeah, I guess it has to be this way. Very funny. Very funny. Yeah
108|Shoot
109|I'm trying to hide this misaligned pillow. Oh, what is this? Maybe if I

115|All right, so we have all gathered here today
116|To give thanks for thy super chats
117|Uh
118|Wait, does anybody know where from where I'm reading from super chat's from my head is too big
119|Oh
120|Hey pecs, well, okay, you guys are so useful. Thank you
121|Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it's like my brains been so blank
122|Like I went to the fish store to buy the frogs and I was like talking to the lady. We're like talking about
123|Oh
124|You know coolly loaches that wanted to add to my tank and stuff and then afterwards after I got the frogs
125|I was just like oh my god. I'm so tired. What the heck. It's so mentally draining just to
126|Just to like go outside and talk
127|with person at the store
128|But I think it'll get better yeah, it'll get better I'll still try to still trying to stream
129|I've been getting enough sleep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've been getting enough sleep. I
130|Think it's just especially cuz I was traveling a few weeks ago, and I've been ordering out a lot. I think it's just
131|Not healthy for my tummy. Oh
132|What day was the apex tree well then let me look at the schedule
133|Oh
134|Speaking of the schedule I kind of have it lined up
135|For the next
136|The next coming this coming week, let's see
137|I will tell you guys but first let me see what day that effects was
138|Oh wasn't that on Monday? When it was not on Monday
139|Wait, yes, it was a Monday
140|No
141|It was on Tuesday
142|Okay, okay
143|Sorry, sorry
144|Okay, so I'll tell you guys the schedule
145|sort of
146|Yeah, the loose schedule for this week. Well, not sort of I'm gonna try to stick to it tomorrow. We'll play Elden ring
147|starting at AMT time and
148|Then on Tuesday, I didn't really plan out this day because we're doing the Mario Kart this day, I think
149|So I think it's it's gonna be at the same time. We scheduled that or it might be a little bit earlier
150|So that'd be Mario Kart collab that we had to reschedule last week
151|Um, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do a Tuesday night. I'm not sure yet
152|If I do anything and then on Wednesday, we have a member stream
153|I looked at the list and I remember one of the things I said was the horror stream
154|So there was a horror game that we can do for members. I don't know if I don't know
155|I don't know if it's a good game, but I guess we'll find out and
156|Then also that night I will probably play more Elden ring
157|I might switch it out for something else though and then on Thursday. Um, I have rust here with a question mark
158|So I'm not sure
159|If it's gonna be on that day
160|But I might just try to play rust on that day. Oh, I don't have anything else planned for that day. Oh
161|Then on Friday
162|What does this music stop to get? It doesn't let me play the next one
163|Keep having to refresh it every time
164|Hold on. Let me check. Let me refresh for real. I'll get us restart the bubble box stream. I think it's being really lame right now
165|I
166|I
167|I
168|Okay, hopefully I fix it you guys here Bubba, okay. Yeah bubbles barking at something
169|That's cuz yeah bubba bubba what the heck bubba you're supposed to be DJing
170|All right, and then on Friday, I don't have anything planned I'm not sure yet and then on Saturday
171|We'll watch spider-man 2 and then I thought we could do the wheel stream again
172|Probably get a few different games, you know, maybe some
173|Minecraft or something and then super Sunday. See I'm still in the middle of planning it
174|Is that like a bird an alarm
175|Alright super chats from
176|Five days ago got it. Oh
177|But before we read super chat, she's gonna see look look look wait
178|Oh
179|Look at this wait, it's too big
180|Hold on oh
181|It's gone and disappeared what the heck
182|Oh
183|It's gone oh
184|Alright hold on I have to manually shrink it. Oh, yes, everything is being weird today
185|Look at the starfish
186|Let me restart from the beginning. I found I these are starfish that I've seen on the rocks in my tank
187|But now I got it on the I got I found it on the glass and I could zoom in and get a close-up of it
188|Obviously the starfish is missing one leg. I think it did it on purpose
189|to reproduce or whatever because I've seen like other starfish that was only it only had like two legs, so
190|Yeah, so this is in real time it crawling like across the glass
191|It's cute, right?
192|You can see the mouth in the center there
193|Or is it the butthole? I don't know that much about starfish anatomy
194|Yeah, they got those little feelers that they use to crawl across the
195|You know the land
196|The little feet which are also tongues I think and we started to
197|Yeah, both it's both weird
198|Yeah, it's so cute. It's so small
199|so small and then also
200|Right now, where did it go? Oh, it's so small
201|This is real time. Hold on. I want to pause it because it goes by fast. This is a new anemone that I bought
202|It's um
203|Can I use the point?
204|It's uh, let me see. I must have something to point with I need a pointer
205|like a little cursor to drag around the screen
206|Alright, I'll point with
207|This my detached arm this right here. This is a really small anemone
208|I think it's a bubble tip anemone. Yeah, I was at the fish store and
209|the guy at the fish store was I was like buying my stuff and
210|Then I was like, oh, what's that thing on the glass?
211|it's
212|Okay, the video was unavailable
213|Anyways, I was like, what is that thing on the glass and he was like, oh, it's just a little one of my nominees that cloned
214|I'll sell it to you for ten bucks and I was like, oh
215|Well since you're offering okay, I got it for ten bucks and let's sit your baby you can see how small it is
216|It's the same size as a small hermit crab. So it's really small and I saw them together again this morning
217|They were like together the whole night and they formed a symbiotic relationship because what happens is that the hermit crab
218|Yeah, they form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone because the anemone will sting
219|things that might try to catch the hermit crab like octopus or squid and
220|In return the hermit crab eats its food and shares the little bits that fall off with the anemone
221|So they have like a really cute relationship
222|Anyways, this video that I took is um, I had just turned on the light to check on it on them
223|Um, and this is the anemone opening up in real time. Mm-hmm
224|Now you could see it
225|It's like a it's like a flower opening up so it's not sped up or anything
226|This is how it opens up in real time. And then when it closes, it looks really cute, too
227|Look, they're holding hands right there. Where did I see? He's touching it
228|Yeah, they're very cute and it has this anemone has such a pretty color
229|Although I was I didn't think about it to be honest when I bought it
230|But uh, I was after I bought it I got really worried. I was like, oh, what if I do actually have a bobbit worm
231|So I've been keeping an eye on the tank like at night. Um, I haven't I don't know
232|I've never really seen any signs of a bobbit worm other than one of the the only fish that I had in tank disappearing
233|So, I don't know. I mean Mogu was skinny and
234|Stressed out so it couldn't it's it's not guaranteed that there was a bobbit worm
235|But apparently they do try to eat anemones. So I guess we'll see I'll try to keep a close eye on it
236|I want to protect it
237|Yeah, this a anemone
238|It's moved. It's it's moved up a little bit on this rock and yeah, I found them together again this morning. So cute
239|They're so cute. And then
240|And then let me see, hold on
241|Hold on
242|Hold on, hold on, I guess it's too zoomed in
243|Okay, now I will show you guys
244|The frog
245|After I change something really quick
246|Um
247|This one
248|Okay, I use this image watch as I transform this arm
249|You frog
250|Yeah, why is it so so big? Oh shoot. Okay. Hold on. I messed it up
251|All that, I'm shrinking the image. Oh when I take a picture, it's like 400,000 pixels
252|There's one of the frogs
253|Um, kind of floating. Yeah, floating and um
254|He wasn't always floating he was just doing it to get air so they stayed in the tank in the water
255|They're fully aquatic, but they actually go up to the surface to get air
256|And so he was just like going up to the surface to get some air
257|Yeah, African dwarf frog. I got two of them. I don't have a picture of both of them together
258|But let me see
259|No, this is the only picture I have actually
260|Yeah, this is the frog I fed them again
261|Um, I fed them like as soon as I added them into the tank because they seemed kind of hungry and then I fed them
262|Again this morning. Well, I only fed one of them this morning because it was really skinny
263|Are they both males? I don't know. I guess we'll find out
264|Um, they seem to be chilling though. The tank's really long. So they have a lot of space
265|Yeah, we'll see
266|Look at them. I need to zoom in
267|Are they gonna make tadpoles? I don't know. I think if they did make tadpoles probably my fish would eat them
268|But yeah for my freshwater tank. I want to get some freshwater clams
269|Seems cute
270|What do they eat? I feed them bloodworms, but they also eat like pellets
271|They'll eat flakes if you like hold it right in front of their face
272|They'll pretty much eat anything that you hold in front of their face because I was trying to feed one this morning
273|And it was eating the sand because it kept like trying to go for the worm and it kept missing
274|So it was getting a mouthful of sand
275|Oh, but it did spit it out. It didn't actually eat it
276|No, they don't usually bother shrimp
277|Not that I've seen anyway
278|I guess it's possible they could eat something. They'll eat like whatever fits in their mouth
279|But they're also really really blind. So I don't think they'll be able to eat anything
280|I
281|Everything's always so good. Well, there's so many red super chats at the top of the chat today. Thank you guys
282|Okay, now I will for real start reading super chats and probably get distracted
283|But it doesn't look like we have too much to go

305|I'm not that good at FPS games. I think I have my moments in like FPS games
306|But overall I don't think I'm that great of a player. I just have really good
307|I've like I have times where I'm really focused in and I actually do well
308|Then most of the time I just get distracted like I start reading chat and then I start following my teammates
309|They start messing around in the game
310|Yeah, it's it's well
311|It's distracting streaming and playing at the same time because you know, there's so much all these people in chat. I could talk to

338|Bonsie, thank you
339|Well, the thing is yes as you should turn you should turn back on the screen when playing apex as you're about to land
340|So then nobody can follow you but it's difficult because if I'm the jump master
341|I have to be tapped into the game to
342|Well, I could put it on a hotkey
343|Yeah, I could put it on a hockey like uh, I
344|Guess it would be like this. Hold on. Let me see I can show you guys a demonstration if you will
345|Like that it would be just like that. Yeah, I'll put it on a hockey. That's a good idea. Thanks. I'm it

352|I don't really have cravings for chips
353|Yeah
354|It's a lessons. Thank you
355|And new a sign I got dog
356|Can you stay I was a thank you. I shoot a sucky. Thank you gentlemen
357|Thank you. Oh, yeah, I learned something today
358|Well, it was like while I was reading
359|researching some stuff
360|Apparently if you guys look at your nails right now
361|Do you guys have like a little white half moon at the bottom part of your nail where it like connects to your finger?
362|Do you guys have that check check?
363|everybody check
364|Yes, yes, yep, nope. No. Yes. Yes
365|Yeah, it's called the wait. I forget what it's called Luna lei. I think Luna lei
366|Uh-huh. Yeah, it means yet. It means if you're missing it, it might mean that you have
367|issues with like nutrition or vitamins
368|Uh-huh. Wait, let me look up the right name
369|Yeah, it's called a Luna lei
370|Luna lei, it's the crescent shaped whitish area of the bed of a nail or toenail and
371|And if you don't have it, it might indicate some underlying conditions
372|It's possible that it could mm-hmm. Well, that's what it says on the internet anyways
373|But I'm sure there's probably like some studies that proved it wrong or something
374|That's good. Yeah, it's good if you have one. I don't have any I
375|Don't have any no you won't I wait do I have any looking at my toenails, right? I have one on my big toe
376|Oh
377|That's good, maybe my I guess my feet are healthier
378|Yeah, yeah looking at look up it's like when you can tell what color it's like the color of stuff that comes out of your
379|Body indicates, you know like things in your body, right?
380|Yeah, I'm all nervous from lack of I'm a
381|Okay, okay. Oh, yeah, I like this song nice. Okay. Oh, where was I reading super chats back to super chats?
382|Pick a right thing here. Oh, that would be cool. I need toe. Thank you. It is named on sites with fuse old for six times
383|zoom, oh
384|I want to play more fuse
385|Is the season starting again soon on apex? Maybe I'll give it the good old try
386|I'll try hard
387|We'll see I
388|Was like just getting out of silver or just getting out of bronze it
389|It's such a huge time sink. I feel like climbing ranks in CS go is probably easier or like an overwatch
390|It takes less time. Well, I don't know
391|I guess if you're winning every single game if you're getting like 200 RP every single game in apex
392|Maybe it's not that much time
393|But maybe because I spend a lot of time in games where I get like 60 RP or something and then we die
394|Seems yeah, it seems really grindy though
395|Hmm
396|Mm-hmm. There's a new rank. So it makes it harder. Oh, oh right. Yeah, cuz they have like the new brink or something
397|Rookie that's what it is. I guess it would be insulting if they called it noob
398|Hmm it seems satisfying, you know get up there. Oh
399|Okay
400|Sorry, I have this like leftover
401|Skin bubble from a blister. I just felt that you
402|You

622|Yes, yes, no, Small Amet had a booster seat.
623|Yeah, it was okay.
624|Take that look from off your face.
625|See, you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out.

628|Well, yeah, go to side, oh, thank you.
629|Thank you, Small Amet, cause you reached the pedal.

634|please run me over, Small Amet.

649|Which ones would you get?
650|I did, I got the main one.
651|And I think I got Mumei's,
652|because I liked how kind of subtle it was.
653|And then also Fauna's sweater.
654|And, oh, that was cool.
655|I get it for free.
656|I don't order Mumei's birthday merch.
657|I think I'm, I think I'm done ordering people's merch,
658|because I always forget.
659|It always, well, I get like a ton of emails
660|from before the haul.
661|Does that still happen with the Hololive shop
662|where if you order merch, like it gives you an email
663|and it's like, it's at a warehouse.
664|Please pay, blah, blah, blah, blah.
665|And I'm just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
666|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
667|Yeah, Fauna's sweater is so cute.
668|Not from the official store.
669|Okay, because I have a ton of stuff that I got from Byee
670|and it was, well, they have extras now, I guess.
671|I mean, it's still mine, it's so, you know,
672|I just like supported them, I guess.
673|I just never got the item.
674|Ah, ah, ah.
675|Magic, magic.
676|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

680|Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
681|It's magic, magic.
682|I can't read, it's too small.
683|All I have to do is think of you
684|to make the music start to play.
685|Then I dance from down the street and I'm, I can't read.
686|Hey, hey, hey, magic ways.
687|Ooh, you love the girl with magic ways.
688|And it's true.
689|Oh, I can't read, it's too small.
690|The text is too small, I'm struggling here.
691|Okay.
692|Night and night and oh, sweet magic ways.
693|Oh, where was I?
694|Oh, Ricardo, thank you.
695|Oh, Reginald, thank you.
696|Oh, I want to translate this one.
697|Magic, magic.
698|Thank you, thank you, thank you profile, so cute.
699|Must be my new YouTube, I want to say Yo YouTube.
700|My new YouTube profile picture, thank you.
701|I think that it was the, well,
702|I was just like looking through Pixel
703|and I was trying so many different pictures
704|and like it's just that, you know,
705|having blonde hair and being super pale,
706|it's kind of hard with contrast,
707|like to find a good image that contrasts properly
708|for like a small profile picture.
709|So I was just Googling my name
710|and looking through the images and I found this one
711|and I'm pretty sure this is like one of the first images
712|I tweeted, like right after our debut announcement.
713|So I just tried it and it actually didn't look so bad.
714|So I decided to keep it.
715|Magic, magic.
716|Oh, right dude, thank you.
717|Yuste, kam samita.
718|I ate Amaz menu at a collaboration cafe yesterday.
719|It was really good.
720|Hope there'll be more events like this next time.
721|Oh, thank you, kam samita, kam amo yo.
722|Yeah, about the cafe in Korea.
723|And yeah, I saw like what Kyara shared,
724|like some pictures of some very dedicated
725|Hello Live fans camping out just to get into the cafe,
726|like camping out like 12 hours or something before it opens.
727|I think they were camping out like at midnight,
728|waiting for it to open
729|because there's not a lot of spots in the cafe.
730|So take some dedication, you know.
731|It's just, no one was expecting such a large turnout
732|for the cafe, so thank you, kam samita.
733|Yeah, they're very dedicated
734|and they seem really happy too.
735|I'd love for everybody to be able to go to cafe like that.
736|It'd be awesome.
737|Well, not one where you have to wait, you know, so long,
738|but still.
739|Yeah, that's true.
740|They keep underestimating us.
741|When will they learn?
742|Psycho, thank you.
743|Oh, some coins, thank you.
744|Pick a ring, thank you.
745|Oh yeah, I saw.
746|Was there like for real GTA six announcement?
747|Or was it like a leak or something?
748|I'm ending things, I know.
749|Oh, it's real.
750|They're working on it.
751|Didn't it take like 10 years for GTA five
752|or some like really long amount?
753|Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
754|Cool, I definitely played GTA six
755|when it comes out in four years.
756|Storm blade, thank you.
757|I believe Smulama did isekai some people on that.
758|Faithful day.
759|Storm, oh wait, right next, thank you.
760|YouTube crashed again, thank you.
761|I'm gonna get a close chat.
762|All right.
763|Where was I?
764|Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
765|Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
766|Thank you, the song is distracting.
767|TK, thank you.
768|Can you say I'm saying thank you?
769|Reindeer, thank you.
770|I'm a reed.
771|Thank you, some, oh, attack a goalie, thank you.
772|I almost said Smulama.
773|Yeah, investigators meeting, uh-huh, uh-huh.
774|Thank you for the support.
775|I didn't go, we didn't go, thank you.
776|Are we there yet?
777|I have to use the bathroom.
778|Bubba hit me, it's too hot.
779|Can we get McDonald's over there yet?
780|Shut up.
781|Aw, cute.
782|A new song, arigato.
783|Yejun, thank you.
784|Last time someone drew a picture of Smulama standing outside the big truck
785|fighting a piece of wheat straw,
786|does Smulama want to find someone's mother again?
787|Smulama's got a whole phone book,
788|whole of, uh, you know,
789|you know, uh, victims, nah, nah, nah.
790|Friends.
791|Smulama's got a lot of friends.
792|Or to the, thank you.
793|Thank you.
794|Halfwayang, thank you.
795|Yeah, GTA 5, the Europe map DLC.
796|Can I say I'm saying cute?
797|Taro Cube, saying cute.
798|Maybe trucker Smulama's license from the wrong timeline.
799|Yeah, I think so.
800|Yeah, it's not very valid here.
801|Airbumble, thank you.
802|Pickle Rick times two, thank you.
803|Boss music in Eurotrucks.
804|I guess there was as we were parking.
805|We have a day, thank you.
806|I'm glad you enjoyed the stream, thank you.
807|Thank you.
808|Thank you.
809|Yeah, everybody left the factory,
810|the carrot factory as Smulama was trying to deliver.
811|I guess it would be the, I don't know, processing plant maybe.
812|Uh-huh.
813|Damn, you could fit a lot of carrots in like a 22-foot long truck, huh?
814|Like tons and tons of carrots.
815|Whoa.
816|Okay, thank you.
817|This is harder than me landing on a sun station or parking a truck.
818|The sun station took way longer.
819|Mila, what's up, Detective Extraordinaire, thank you.
820|Hey, Solasos, thank you.
821|Wouldn't it be cool if truck sim had a Fallout mod?
822|It sounds very specific.
823|I guess it'd be more believable if Fallout had a truck sim mod.
824|Uh, Amadeus, thank you.
825|Hidezuki, thank you.
826|By color, thank you.
827|Up a creek, thank you.
828|Yeah, I'll just get a real truck and see how it is, how it really is.
829|Uh, Dunlides, thank you.
830|Uh, Slotham, thank you.
831|Nice boat, thank you.
832|Isute, Kamsamita.
833|Wait, is this what it says? Let me double check.
834|Okay, Multi, thank you.
835|Wajaleo, thank you.
836|Twilight, thank you.
837|Fishstar, thank you.
838|Alright, only about 20% left of the superchets, including the ones from the stream.
839|Itchy.
840|Hold on.
841|Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
842|It's a guy's simulator, I like that.
843|Uh, Rekukun, thank you.
844|Um, A screen, thank you.
845|Truckson.
846|Can I say it? So thank you.
847|Thank you for watching.
848|Kamsamita.
849|Kamsamita.
850|Jiho, komawa yo.
851|Mayscreen, thank you.
852|Aw, thank you.
853|Kuristai, thank you.
854|Alright, now superchets from two days ago. What did we do two days ago?
855|Oh, wait, is this from the free chat? Oh, no.
856|Okay, I guess there's some from the free chat and then some from the today stream.
857|Kuristai, thank you.
858|Oh, Rekukun, thank you.
859|I'm at Crunchyroll Expo for the next two days.
860|I'll be the vlogging. Oh, nice.
861|Did I stream? I don't remember.
862|Just in time, thank you.
863|I hope you enjoyed the convention.
864|Oh, karaoke.
865|Rekukun, thank you.
866|Oh, oh, yes.
867|It was really cool. I don't know if it was in the stream,
868|but like during when Gura was singing, like on my end,
869|I was getting like fade in and fade out of like the crowd,
870|close up of like the crowd with their light sticks and it looked like a real concert
871|and it was so cool, such a cool moment, even though it's really short
872|because Gura only sang like the first verse in the chorus for Shiny Smiley Story.
873|Aw, so was it on the stream, like the crowd waving their glow sticks and stuff?
874|Aw, cool.
875|Yeah, it was really cool.
876|I'm glad she agreed because I think she's busy like recording,
877|so her voice was not that great.
878|She didn't have a lot of sleep in the first place,
879|so I'm glad I'm gonna, I hope it wasn't too much pressure,
880|but yeah, it was a really cool moment to see Gura like,
881|it's so magic when she sings, you know what I mean?
882|And seeing like everybody's live reaction to it too.
883|It's so cool.
884|Mm-hmm, so magical.
885|Aw, where was I?
886|Aw, I made me a thank you.
887|How was it to meet some of your fans?
888|I think it was cool, I don't know, maybe I was not that great at conversation,
889|so I was just like, there'd be like a kind of a pause and I'd say,
890|well, how was your convention going?
891|Did you see the KFP stand?
892|I had some topics, you know, did you buy anything today?
893|Did you see the Artist Alley?
894|How many did I meet?
895|I think, I don't know the exact number,
896|but I know it was supposed to be like around 20 or so.
897|I think a little bit more than 20.
898|Aw, okay, good, thank you.
899|I was one of the Santiago cosplayers, oh cool.
900|Good, it's a bad influence.
901|Good, I didn't mention feet at all at first.
902|It was just some guy in the crowd.
903|Ms. Mint, thank you.
904|Yeah, we made a thank you.
905|Can I ask about the coin purse?
906|It's super cute and I want one.
907|I think I want it from an arcade or something at some point,
908|like a long time ago.
909|Oh yeah, just so you can put coins and stuff in it.
910|Pickle Rick, thank you.
911|Next meeting greets, yeah.
912|I wouldn't mind doing them as often.
913|This is convention season still right now,
914|but during convention season I don't mind doing it.
915|It only took like two hours, but it was pretty fun.
916|I think doing the panel was more difficult
917|than doing the meeting greets because,
918|well, usually in the past when we do panels,
919|there's somebody, you know, there's like an MC
920|who deals with handling the crowd
921|and asking questions and things like that
922|and just keeping the flow going for the panel,
923|but because it was up to each of us,
924|Good and I were talking about different ideas
925|that we could do for the panel,
926|and we just didn't come to a conclusion
927|of what it is we should do because we had some ideas.
928|I think one was doing a live AI dungeon session or something,
929|and I was like, oh, we could look at funny animal videos.
930|So we had a lot of ideas,
931|but we ended up just going with like what staff recommended,
932|like, oh, just, you know, questions.
933|MeTuber support, okay.
934|It was easy.
935|And then, yeah, everybody had like six in the crowd,
936|so I really wanted to, you know,
937|work with that too and do a little musical thing.
938|Yeah, well, I had an idea to do like a 3D panel.
939|I was gonna, well, first I wanted to see how feasible it was.
940|If I could even get the effect, it's called an anaglyph.
941|If I could even get that effect in OBS,
942|which it kind of worked.
943|I think it kind of worked, but it was a little difficult.
944|I think if I could perfect it, then it would work.
945|But, yeah, I was thinking maybe we can ask Crunchyroll
946|if we could hand out.
947|I think it was like 2,000 people in the panel hall.
948|If we could hand out like blue and red,
949|those paper 3D glasses, and then print it on it,
950|something like the Amish, Amish panel or something.
951|I feel like it's a cool thing to take home.
952|You know, you just have it, and it's like a memorabilia thing.
953|But I think it was too last minute anyways.
954|Well, I don't know, maybe they would have been it.
955|I don't even know how that would be possible.
956|I know you can rent 3D glasses.
957|You can rent like the polarized 3D glasses,
958|but those work differently.
959|It's like it takes...
960|Hmm.
961|I kind of understand how those like regular black frame 3D glasses work.
962|It like polarizes light circularly.
963|And so what it is, is like when you're watching
964|one of those 3D movies in theaters,
965|is they have like two projectors going,
966|or one that switches really fast back and forth,
967|and they're polarized.
968|Circularly polarized in opposite directions,
969|and each lens only allows one directional,
970|one direction of light, of the polarized light coming through.
971|I think I get it.
972|Yeah, but I couldn't figure out.
973|Obviously, I don't think it's possible with like computer monitors and stuff.
974|Unless we had a special projector.
975|It's magic! Yeah, it's magic.
976|How do they work?
977|Um...
978|Okay, yeah, light wave physics.
979|It was interesting watching.
980|I was like, oh, I just wanted a 3D stream,
981|but this is like pretty complicated.
982|They like talking about, you know, the light waves
983|and how they're electrically magnetized and whatever.
984|And I'm just like, okay, I get this, I get it.
985|I don't even think I took a physics class.
986|Oh, no.
987|I kind of took a physics class, yeah.
988|Oh, but I got it in the end, I got it.
989|Two YouTube tutorials later.
990|How do magnets work?
991|I don't know, how do they work?
992|It's magic.
993|Um...
994|Let's see.
995|Where was I?
996|Uh, George dedicated to me, thank you.
997|Yeah, I think, well, my manager was like,
998|I'm glad you liked the meeting group because, you know,
999|I guess it sort of implied there might be something else
1000|coming up soon, so I don't know.
1001|I think if there's some other conventions coming up soon,
1002|it's possible that Halef might make an appearance,
1003|but I'm not sure yet.
1004|Uh, no confirmations yet.
1005|Uh, Vercatos, thank you.
1006|Oh, yeah, the top ten favorite anime.
1007|My memory's so bad, like, I couldn't even remember
1008|some of the anime that I really liked.
1009|So I just put, like, a anime that I knew that I liked
1010|and that I remembered that I liked,
1011|but I think there's some anime that I really liked too
1012|that I didn't remember to put on the list, if that makes sense.
1013|Uh, can I say I'm saying kyuuu?
1014|Congratulations!
1015|A marriage, whoa!
1016|Nice, thank you for the support.
1017|I hope they have a successful marriage.
1018|Marriage.
1019|SS109, thank you.
1020|Picoric, thank you.
1021|Did you really see the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life?
1022|Yes, I have seen the Fortnite Battle Bus in real life.
1023|It was not a joke, I've actually seen it.
1024|Um...
1025|Amidoko kamsamita!
1026|Ah, come on way up.
1027|Fates, thank you.
1028|Yo, yo, yo.
1029|I'm reading Super Chats from this stream, by the way.
1030|Amazing sand, thank you.
1031|Yeah, I don't know if we'll do the same thing
1032|for next year's Crunchyroll convention,
1033|but it did seem like a lot of fun,
1034|especially I just tweeted something before the stream.
1035|Everybody's like, ame, ame.
1036|And a small ame is there, I was there dancing.
1037|A small ame was there dancing.
1038|Uh, yeah, it seems like fun though.
1039|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1040|It doesn't have to be, you know,
1041|only if your whole life fan is doing general, general anime stuff.
1042|Um...
1043|Um, Mephi, thank you.
1044|Super Sunday time.
1045|Stratus fight, thank you.
1046|Immediates, thank you.
1047|Bus, thank you.
1048|You can get a degree at the panel the other day.
1049|Thanks so well.
1050|How different was it singing
1051|and being able to watch the crowd?
1052|Uh, I don't think I was watching the crowd during the...
1053|Uh, yeah, when I was singing during my portion,
1054|I wasn't watching the crowd
1055|because I was looking at the lyrics.
1056|But, um, yeah, like I said,
1057|watching the crowd during Kura was really cool too.
1058|Mm-hmm.
1059|And Smart Boy, thank you.
1060|Yeah, you'd think I'd memorize the lyrics too.
1061|Puru put it in at this point.
1062|But you just don't know.
1063|I just wanted to make sure I got it right.
1064|Yeah, I'd love to see you guys at more conventions.
1065|That'd be cool.
1066|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1067|Tried making amine last night.
1068|It tasted pretty good.
1069|Oh, nice. It wasn't too sweet.
1070|I'm glad you liked it.
1071|Video mote, thank you for the best of the chat.
1072|Aww.
1073|Oh, thank you.
1074|Thank you for the question.
1075|I'm glad you enjoyed the panel.
1076|I-R-L.
1077|Mm-hmm.
1078|Yeah, I'm done.
1079|Mm-hmm.
1080|Yesterday, I got something to do.
1081|This song sounds...
1082|This song sounds kind of sad.
1083|But, uh, it sounds like it's picking up a bit.
1084|Alpha 9 5 7 1.
1085|Ooh.
1086|Cool.
1087|Alpha 9 5 7 1, thank you.
1088|Yeah, I hope you guys can make it to a mid-grade 2 coming soon near you.
1089|Thank you.
1090|Thank you.
1091|Thank you.
1092|Aww, thank you.
1093|I'm glad you enjoyed.
1094|Wait.
1095|Thank you.
1096|I'll see you laughing.
1097|Thank you.
1098|Ask Pei.
1099|Thank you.
1100|Are you able to upload some animated emotes to Twitch someday?
1101|Maybe, perhaps?
1102|Uh, I think it's an affiliate.
1103|I don't remember if there were that many slots for it, but I'll look into it.
1104|Yeah, I wanted to add a subscribers badge for Twitch, too.
1105|So, I'll, uh, get started on that.
1106|Mm-hmm.
1107|Ifmefa, thank you.
1108|Oh.
1109|Aww, thank you.
1110|Aww, thank you.
1111|Hola, Aime te quiero mucho.
1112|Esta ludos desde Chile.
1113|Oh, Chile.
1114|Very chill.
1115|Muchas gracias.
1116|Anti-whippy, thank you.
1117|It sometimes feels really for you that small Aime has broken out something so big.
1118|She even became Ian's old mascot.
1119|You envision her coming this far when you first brought her to be somewhat irregular?
1120|Oh.
1121|Well, yeah, small Aime is really popular.
1122|I'm kind of nervous that, like, maybe I'm not doing enough on social media, you know, being small Aime.
1123|So, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to be better and be a better small Aime.
1124|You know, because I'm small Aime's manager, actually, and I have to represent small Aime.
1125|So, yeah.
1126|But, yeah, it is really crazy.
1127|It is surprising.
1128|But, small Aime did have, like, a lot of memes when we started putting out, like, a lot of small Aime gifts and stuff,
1129|and people started using them in memes.
1130|So, I feel like small Aime has evolved, you know.
1131|She's, like, 40 now.
1132|Small Aime is the real idol here.
1133|Maybe we should have a small Aime concert.
1134|What do you guys think?
1135|Oh, there's an idea.
1136|Hey, I can do it on my own.
1137|Well, not all alone, but...
1138|Huh.
1139|All right, well, stay tuned.
1140|Flynn Playmable, thank you.
1141|Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was sweet.
1142|TK, thank you.
1143|First, Akka Super Chat.
1144|Oh, that was a solid one.
1145|Thank you so much, TK.
1146|Aw, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it.
1147|Princess Niche, thank you for the big support chat.
1148|Thank you.
1149|At TotoCubes, thank you.
1150|Have I got a chance to go to an expo one day?
1151|Yeah, now that things are opening up a little bit more.
1152|Me too.
1153|Last time, 39. Thank you.
1154|The birthday shirt merch just arrived recently.
1155|It looks so good.
1156|Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate there's only one size.
1157|Hmm, but you can always hang it up or something, you know?
1158|Yeah, a lot of teammates that came to the...
1159|Well, a few teammates that came to the meet-and-greet were wearing the Ame shirt.
1160|Right next, thank you.
1161|Does Mama get put back in the box?
1162|Uh, yeah, she probably finally got apprehended again.
1163|I know she's probably infected or something, so she's got to stay in the box, you know?
1164|At TK, thank you.
1165|Oh, thank you for that. Oh, another big sub-jet.
1166|Aw.
1167|Aw, thank you so much. That's so sweet.
1168|I'm glad you enjoyed the streams.
1169|Thank you, thank you for the support.
1170|Thank you.
1171|Rock the gas bar. Rock the gas bar.
1172|I'm in it all night.
1173|Rock the gas bar. Rock the...
1174|Lock the taskbar.
1175|All right, dear. Thank you.
1176|Yeah.
1177|It was pretty tough keeping small. I'm in check, but, uh...
1178|You know, I think she's getting better.
1179|I think she's improving a little bit.
1180|Uh, Lynn, thank you.
1181|YouTube has been recommending me saltwater tank videos.
1182|There's this guy that bought $2,000 worth of fish, et cetera,
1183|and even has a shark egg.
1184|Yeah, there's so many of those videos on YouTube that's like,
1185|fish haul, I just bought $5,000 worth of fish.
1186|Watch me put them in.
1187|And then it's like the guy opening up the video, and he's like,
1188|what's up, fish heads?
1189|And then he, like, talks for 10 minutes, and then finally unboxes the fish.
1190|And it's not even that cool when you see it.
1191|I do, though, I do on YouTube watch, uh...
1192|They're, like, these two-hour compilations of people with, like,
1193|really high-quality videos of their tanks.
1194|And they do, like, really close-up, like, macro shots,
1195|and there's, like, relaxing music, so...
1196|That's, like, a good thing to put on in the background.
1197|Uh, Kram, thank you so much!
1198|Another big substitute!
1199|It just says,
1200|I'm in!
1201|Thank you so much for the support.
1202|TK, the third big super check!
1203|Thank you so much!
1204|Huh?
1205|Aww, thank you, TK.
1206|So sweet!
1207|I see another one here, but TK, again.
1208|Here, look, he's always so fun.
1209|Game streams, always entertaining.
1210|Chatty watch a lot of the super chat,
1211|but his stream is so comfy,
1212|and video stream projects always spark excitement.
1213|Aww, thank you, thank you, thank you!
1214|Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1215|So sweet!
1216|Thank you so much!
1217|I really appreciate it.
1218|I'm glad, uh, you know,
1219|at the end of the day,
1220|if you guys enjoyed the stream somewhat,
1221|I'm happy, so thank you.
1222|And Majin D, thank you!
1223|Majin 8, thank you!
1224|I'll see you in the bar!
1225|Traveling home from Crenshaw Expo,
1226|I hope you get there safe.
1227|I hope you win the lottery one day for the...
1228|not just the regular lottery,
1229|the main green lottery, I guess.
1230|Uh, right here!
1231|Thank you!
1232|Endless Ame!
1233|Only around Halloween.
1234|Rock the guest box!
1235|Ame, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee!
1236|Uh, Roger Liao, thank you!
1237|Ame, ame, ame, ame, ame!
1238|A12 Flames.
1239|Thank you!
1240|Oh!
1241|Oh, the deep skies nuts!
1242|Yeah, that was a tweet that I read during the panel.
1243|Thank you for the question!
1244|Uh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1245|Oh my god, this song is really loud.
1246|Okay.
1247|Okay, just the piano was really loud at the start.
1248|Uh, where was I?
1249|Oh, Mass Man Today, thank you!
1250|Small minute at large, at Crenshaw Expo.
1251|Uh-huh.
1252|Uh, GK, thank you for another big supper chat!
1253|Oh!
1254|Uh, thank you so much!
1255|Thank you!
1256|I hope you also have a yummy food!
1257|Mm-hmm!
1258|Thank you so much for all the support.
1259|I appreciate it.
1260|Nagi!
1261|Oh, thank you!
1262|Mason Experience Music Meeting at Crenshaw Expo!
1263|Oh, it was really sweet!
1264|Thank you so much!
1265|Nagi's so cute!
1266|So cute!
1267|Yeah, we got some pictures together.
1268|Thank you, thank you for all your support.
1269|I'm glad, uh, I'm glad you're able to make it to the convention and into the meeting greet.
1270|Thank you!
1271|So many cute teammates!
1272|Thank you!
1273|Uh, oh yeah, the figures that were posted, is the pop-up parade ones.
1274|Did I have any input for the figure?
1275|Uh, I think I had the option to provide, like, a reference that I might need to want something similar for the pose for the figure,
1276|but I decided to leave it up to Navi Mama, so thank you, Navi Mama, for my adorable figure pose.
1277|I think it was for that one.
1278|Mm-hmm.
1279|Aaron Pampo, thank you!
1280|Happy birthday!
1281|This year my sister made me an amé statue, this year she made me custom amé keep caps.
1282|Ooh, an amé party!
1283|Dang, amé cake!
1284|Amé day!
1285|No, just kidding.
1286|I hope the cake was tasty.
1287|I mean, if it had me on it, it was definitely pretty tasty.
1288|Aw, well thank you, happy birthday!
1289|I hope you have a good rest of the day.
1290|Night!
1291|Yeah, custom keycaps, keycaps, cake?
1292|Amé cake?
1293|Mm-hmm, amé party!
1294|Very cool.
1295|A flag armor, thank you!
1296|I'll be out of blackberries!
1297|No, no, they're still on the...
1298|They left them on the counter, they're still there!
1299|Eduardo, thank you!
1300|Uh, hi, Amé, in your interview you mentioned that songs are coming soon.
1301|Did you mean the cover with Navi or can we expect another one soon?
1302|Did I say that?
1303|Oh...
1304|I don't remember.
1305|Uh...
1306|Yes, just assume that...
1307|Yes, uh-huh.
1308|I could be at 9-9, thank you!
1309|Um, many times, thank you!
1310|Yeah, you should try to go, it's a cool going to convention,
1311|because, you know, the people around you,
1312|if you start a conversation with them, which I know is scary,
1313|but more than likely they'll know whatever it is you're talking to them about,
1314|at least have heard of it.
1315|Because, you know, it's like an anime convention,
1316|so if you talk about anime or games, you know, you got something to bond over.
1317|Mm-hmm!
1318|Xinyoung-ho!
1319|Thank you!
1320|Uh, Seo-chan, thank you!
1321|Since you're getting busier lately, do you still, uh,
1322|aim for 22 games in 2022?
1323|How many do I need left?
1324|How many left are there that I need to complete?
1325|I think it's possible, what?
1326|How many months?
1327|We still have 5 months.
1328|I think it's possible.
1329|20 more to go! 19?
1330|Well, I have some shorter games.
1331|Well, when I say shorter, I mean like 10-hour type of games,
1332|that I think we could do.
1333|But yeah, when I'm feeling better, I want to get to that,
1334|and finish, I still have to finish, I want to finish Mafia,
1335|Anion Y, and Mario Galaxy, as I almost said Mario Kart.
1336|I'm gonna beat Mario Kart.
1337|And I know, um,
1338|there's one I've been keeping on the back burner,
1339|but Frog Detective 3 is gonna come out,
1340|and Katana Zero, uh, I still want to play at some point,
1341|and, um, I don't know, I kind of feel like playing,
1342|like a platform or something, like a 2D.
1343|Ooh, I did want to play, um...
1344|Hey!
1345|What was that one game?
1346|I almost said Banjo-Kazooie.
1347|Uh...
1348|Crash Bandicoot!
1349|Yeah, I'm gonna play.
1350|Stray? I don't know, it looks...
1351|It looks cute, but I don't know.
1352|Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
1353|Hang-on Country 2, is that on the...
1354|Switch?
1355|Yeah, I don't know if I read that at some point,
1356|I don't think, I don't know if I can finish it though,
1357|it seems like a game that would take me a while.
1358|Uh...
1359|It is?
1360|Dragon Country 2 would be the first one, didn't we?
1361|We'll see.
1362|Uh, Multi, thank you.
1363|Aww...
1364|Yeah, you gotta eat healthy so you have energy and stuff.
1365|Mm-hmm.
1366|Uh, EricW1, thank you.
1367|Yeah, I think there will be another opportunity
1368|to go to Expo and get, do the meet and greet and stuff.
1369|Mm-hmm.
1370|Anyways, thank you.
1371|Don't skip lunch? Yeah, I should have lunch.
1372|I'll take a break here before the next game that we play.
1373|Have a snack.
1374|Maybe I'll make a sandwich.
1375|Uh, Marcela Botero, thank you.
1376|Um, what do you mean, what?
1377|Huh?
1378|Go to start, thank you.
1379|Aww, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the acapella pudurin.
1380|Agent Quirobo, thank you.
1381|Gracias.
1382|Oh, Lord Turnip, thank you.
1383|Would there be a post for the schedule this week?
1384|Mm, I don't know, it's still debating.
1385|I still haven't finished it, so I'm not sure yet.
1386|Mm-hmm.
1387|I think I will post something.
1388|I don't know yet.
1389|If not, then I will post the streams pretty early,
1390|like 24 hours before.
1391|Hopefully, yes, not hopefully, I will, if there's no schedule.
1392|Mm-hmm.
1393|Semen 2016, oh, thank you.
1394|I hope you're having a good day too.
1395|Niko Sek, oh, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed
1396|the Eurotruck sim stream.
1397|You mean?
1398|Yasami-ka!
1399|Thank you.
1400|Antipi, thank you.
1401|Uploading Twitch VOD for YouTube during breakdays
1402|might be a good way to help fill out the week.
1403|Possibly.
1404|That is true.
1405|Oh, Yakitum44, thank you.
1406|I gotta make the Twitch thumbnail.
1407|I keep forgetting.
1408|Yes, I'll make a thumbnail.
1409|It'll be like a Twitch playlist of streams
1410|that I've done on there, and I will upload them there
1411|for archive reasons.
1412|Archival, is that a word?
1413|Uh...
1414|Kirti, uh, Kirti, Kirti?
1415|No, Bart, thank you.
1416|Where's Super Chat?
1417|Sorry, we do pops here.
1418|I wonder if that's one of those names, or if you say it
1419|like a, say something bad or something.
1420|Motherfuckin' Rockas, thank you.
1421|Twitch sucks!
1422|Yeah, well, I think it's from a business perspective
1423|good to stream every now and then.
1424|Okay, like imagine this.
1425|Let's say there's a collab that has three people streaming,
1426|and all three of us are streaming on YouTube.
1427|Okay, we're all streaming to the same audience.
1428|Now, of course there's discoverability,
1429|you know, possible within YouTube,
1430|and that's great because a lot of our, obviously,
1431|our whole audience is on YouTube.
1432|But if you wanna open up to a different audience, okay,
1433|a new people that maybe don't watch Hololive that often,
1434|okay, you could have one person
1435|streaming their perspective on Twitch,
1436|and then you get even more people interested in Hololive.
1437|That's business, baby!
1438|But yeah, I think it's, I don't really mind streaming
1439|like wherever, if it's YouTube or Twitch,
1440|it's like the same, although when I do stream on Twitch,
1441|I do feel like there's more of a possibility of new people.
1442|I don't know.
1443|Maybe it's just all in my head.
1444|I gotta check the statistics.
1445|Yeah, we'll stream on Vimeo.
1446|How about that?
1447|What was the other one?
1448|Video motion.
1449|Thank you.
1450|Thank you.
1451|Oh, gracias.
1452|The motherfucking workers, thank you.
1453|Nanji Misa, arigato.
1454|Ame-chan, kawaii.
1455|Thank you.
1456|Arigato.
1457|Shadowfire, thank you.
1458|Oh, muchas gracias.
1459|Nice.
1460|Ellen Saputro.
1461|Thank you.
1462|Oh, Arowanas.
1463|Yeah, they look cool.
1464|I like them when they're small, when they're babies,
1465|but Arowana is a type of fish.
1466|They get big.
1467|They get really big, and they'll bite you,
1468|and you can bleed and stuff.
1469|It's kind of scary, but yeah, you need a really big tank
1470|for them, because they get up to a foot or longer.
1471|Boi-boo, boi-boo.
1472|They're so cute when they're small,
1473|because their eyes are really big.
1474|Let me see if I can show a picture.
1475|Whoa, what is this?
1476|They have this sack.
1477|A weird sack.
1478|What is this weird sack that they have?
1479|I'll show you this picture.
1480|Oh, see, they're so cute.
1481|Yeah, they're expensive.
1482|See, they have this little weird sack.
1483|Is it like umbilical cord or something, but for fish?
1484|Because it looks like only the babies have them.
1485|What is that?
1486|They're born with it?
1487|A digestion sack?
1488|Yeah, they get really big, though.
1489|Let's see, fully grown.
1490|Here.
1491|Okay, this is like a YouTube thumbnail.
1492|This is good for perspective.
1493|I don't know who that is,
1494|but now you can see perspective, like there's hand compared.
1495|Wait, this looks like Photoshop.
1496|No, it's not real.
1497|It's a clickbait image.
1498|They're not that big.
1499|Let's see if I can find a better picture.
1500|Okay, this is a good one.
1501|Bim, bam, bim, bam.
1502|Oh, my God.
1503|Okay.
1504|Okay.
1505|Yeah.
1506|Yeah, they're cute.
1507|Cute, cute.
1508|Omega hot dog.
1509|Thank you.

1519|Thank you.
1520|I saw a small omelet at this event.
1521|I didn't say we gave her a weapon, but didn't take it away.
1522|Yago was also there.
1523|Didn't do anything to him, right?
1524|Well, have you seen Yago since yesterday?
1525|Or since earlier today?
1526|Suss.
1527|Suss.
1528|Maka, thank you.
1529|This is a big super chat.
1530|If you don't remember backstaters,
1531|don't feel forced to play with what you don't want.
1532|Let me see.
1533|Grindings like neon white.
1534|Hmm?
1535|Yeah, we'll see.
1536|I just feel like for people watching,
1537|maybe it's like repetitive or something.
1538|I do think it is pretty fun, though.
1539|I don't really mind backstating neon white
1540|because I don't even look at chat
1541|unless I ask you guys a question.
1542|I'm sorry, boy.
1543|Thank you.
1544|Ryan, Quebec.
1545|Thank you.
1546|That's right.

1576|It means like it's always or something?
1577|Always.
1578|AirW1, thank you.
1579|Did you hear about the brawl at the restaurant?
1580|Three fish got battered.
1581|Oh, what does Bime use to style her hair at honeycomb?
1582|Oh, I like that one.
1583|That's a good one.
1584|Okay, P-back.
1585|I see.
1586|I see.
1587|Okay.
1588|Hi, Gavin Dorff.
1589|Thank you.
1590|I just went to aquarium on vacation and saw Moray eel.
1591|What's your favorite fish at the aquarium?
1592|I always loved seeing the seahorses and then those fish that are closely related to seahorses.
1593|Like, I forgot what they're called, but they're like dragon fish or something like that.
1594|Something like that?
1595|Oh, what are they called?
1596|Dragon?
1597|Dragon days?
1598|No.
1599|Sea dragons.
1600|Yeah, sea dragons.
1601|And also, those little fish that stick up from the sand.
1602|Pipefish, I think?
1603|They're so cute.
1604|Oh, garden eels.
1605|Yeah, I like seeing those types.
1606|Seahorses especially.
1607|You can keep seahorses as a pet, but I don't think I'm experienced enough as a saltwater
1608|person because I saw one video of this guy and he had seahorses and one of his seahorses
1609|had gas trapped inside of its stomach because, you know, the male seahorses hold baby seahorses
1610|in like a womb where it's like a lot of tissue and stuff and what happens is that after they
1611|give birth, after the baby seahorses leave the stomach, there could be leftover tissue
1612|inside and over time it can start to rot and produce gas and so when there's gas in the
1613|tummy, the seahorse can't swim properly.
1614|It's like on its side and obviously it can die like that.
1615|So the guy who owned the seahorse, you know, was part of his hobby, he had to take the
1616|seahorse out and hold it in his hand and then take like a needle and stab like into like
1617|where the babies come out and like just kind of stab the right place so that the gas expels
1618|so that the seahorse can swim normally again.
1619|So I don't know, I don't think I'd want to have a seahorse because that sounds really scary
1620|to do.
1621|And yeah, he took video of it and stuff and I don't think I could do that.
1622|Yeah, you have to relieve the gas.
1623|Those cows have something like that too because I've seen a video of like a cow where they
1624|like poke something into its tummy and then its tummy like deflates because it had like
1625|a build up of gas.
1626|Yeah, yeah, they become buoyant and stuff, it's not good for them.
1627|Mm-hmm.
1628|It's scary.
1629|What does that happen to us?
1630|Maybe it does.
1631|All right.
1632|Hello, thank you.
1633|Ah, Kenny Stamps, thank you.
1634|Yeah, thank you.
1635|Happy early international cat day to Wellington Henry.
1636|Oh cute, what is that?

1655|That'll one, thank you.
1656|Can I hire Smalmed to come to my birthday party?
1657|That'd be funny.
1658|I'll keep them as a backup plan, yes.
1659|I'll tell Smalmed that could be a good backup plan.
1660|A Vtuber fan, thank you.

1689|A red arrow one now.
1690|All right, let's show the class.
1691|Red arrow one now.
1692|Oh, this looks like a fish who could catch an animal crossing.
1693|Oh, I forgot this image was up here.
1694|Mmm, pretty.
1695|It looks like a big betta fish.
1696|Yeah, very bright colored.
1697|Cute.
1698|They're chunky.
1699|Very chunky.
1700|This is a caption on this one.
1701|It's transporting a rare arrow one.
1702|You can see how big it is compared to the arms.
1703|Yeah, they probably need like, what, 300 gallon tanks or something.
1704|300 or more.
1705|Hot Cheeto fish.
1706|Yeah, it does kind of look like a hot Cheeto.
1707|Okay, stamps.
1708|This is the last Super Chat.
1709|Don't send it anymore.
1710|If you do, just know that I'm not going to read it.
1711|This is the last Super Chat.
1712|Can I say, thanks so much.
1713|I'm glad you enjoyed Super Sundays,
1714|even though they're not as long as they used to be,
1715|but we get a nice condensed version.
1716|And we have time for other stuff later.
1717|All right, well, you guys have six minutes.
1718|Let me go open up steam.
1719|Uh-huh.

1721|Titties.
1722|30 bucks.
1723|I'll make it back.
1724|Wait, should I get Cities Skyline Deluxe Edition?
1725|Because with the Deluxe, it comes with transit and industries.
1726|And Harbor means $10 more.
1727|Get the Deluxe.
1728|All right.
1729|Fine.
1730|All right, I'll wait to buy it after I end this stream
1731|because I'm paranoid.
1732|Okay, it's in the cards, though.
1733|All right, well, anything you guys want to tell me?
1734|Oh, my God, there's only four more minutes left in the stream.
1735|Oh, my God.
1736|Swimsuit wallpaper.
1737|I'm starting to inform you that members-only wallpaper,
1738|which is coming soon, is not a swimsuit-themed one.
1739|But I'll keep that in the Idea Bank.
1740|Oh, no, I'm a doko.
1741|Oh, yeah, the Crunchroll panel.
1742|Yeah, that went well, right?
1743|Yes, yes, the stream is done, but I'll be back in an hour.
1744|I'm going to take a break.
1745|I'm going to clean up an area where I made a mess.
1746|And then I'm going to have a snack.
1747|And then I have to install Cities Skyline, so yes.
1748|Oh, just in time.
